A Venusian spaceship, the Eleanor Roosevelt, is on the trip to Venus.\n\nThe only male passenger, Ferdinand Sparling, feels lonely, and finds escape from that burden in the Venusian woman Butt Lee Brown. But Ferdinand only really escapes from his loneliness when with Butt Lee Brown. Butt Lee Brown is an outlaw, living on the ship with no papers, living with his own gun. He takes Ferdinand to his own quarters for a tour of his secret lifeboat, to prove that he's not like other men, and that men can be good\u2014as good as women.\n\nMr. Butt Lee Brown is the hero of Venus. He is well educated and sophisticated, and he's seen all men as weak and cruel, as the men of Earth are. He takes Ferdinand into his confidence, tells him that the real problem is not the three-out-of-four but the lack of men, especially men like himself. This gives him a new idea for the improvement of things on Venus.\n**A Space Odyssey**\n\nby ARTHUR C. CLARKE\n\n[Transcriber's Note: This is the 1955 Galaxy story  \n\"A Space Odyssey.\" The title  \nof the first British version was  \n\"A Body for Ryder.\" ]\n\nFor thirty days he lay where he had fallen in the silent spaceship, waiting. At the end of that time, he was found by two of the ship's robots and brought back to consciousness with an electric shock.\n\nIt was not clear what had happened. A few words, a picture, a fragment of narrative, had drifted to him through the silence.\n\nOne of them was a question.\n\nHe asked himself a second time, then, what he had seen, what had been the meaning of the picture and fragment of narrative which had reached him through the silence.\n\nNothing changed. He sat silent in the small chamber, immobile, watching his body which lay in the other small chamber.\n\nNo, there was not much to know about these events. He recalled vaguely, as if part of another narrative, some story about the ship's voyage. It had been an interstellar mission, he remembered. Something had gone wrong.\n\nThey had had some failure; the space drive had failed or been disabled; there had been some damage. The ship and crew had turned about and were returning.\n\nHe remembered little bits of it.\n\nBut he could not remember what had happened to him.\n\nThe other two robots, working in the small chamber, had removed his body from the other small chamber. They had been careful to avoid the chest region.\n\nHe did not understand this. Nothing had been damaged in the collision. He had simply been sleeping; he could not find what had gone wrong with it.\n\nThey had woken him, had given him electric shocks to bring the mechanism back into order. Had he been sleeping? What else had he been doing?\n\nHis memory did not go back as far as the ship's voyage. It stopped before their arrival back, in orbit about Jupiter. He had awakened then, when the ship arrived, he supposed.\n\nHe did not know.\n\nHe asked himself the question again.\n\nIf he had been asleep, then when had he been living, what had been his occupations?\n\nThey had come upon something, he thought.\n\nThere had been disaster. At least a ship, a damaged ship, had been found. A spaceship from Earth, an American spaceship.\n\nThey must have taken aboard the men and women who had been aboard the ship, the Americans, a whole ship?\n\nIt must be some other, later story, a later part of the narrative, something.\n\nBut he did not know, had no recollection of it.\n\nHe wondered what these three events, the ship's arrival at Jupiter, arrival back, something having occurred then, the last event before the failure. But his memory did not proceed further.\n\nThe other two robots entered the small chamber. The one that had removed him, then, from his quarters, entered, as well.\n\nThe three robot-machines were now working together at him.\n\nHe asked himself the question.\n\nWhere, what did it mean?\n\nThe three of them, the ship of the Americans, the damaged ship of Earth, and something else, it must be. He was not sure what he had seen, what had been the picture.\n\nThe three robots looked at him.\n\nThey began to examine his body, looking into his head.\n\nHe did not know what they were doing, and he was asleep in the silence",

Arthur knows the men must retreat into a new fortress to continue protecting Britain against Rome's invasion, yet he knows the cost will be too high. Arthur wants nothing more than to protect the last remnant of his court after the disaster that is the fall of Camelot, but Britain deserves more for its loyalty in shielding the island from the Romans. So Arthur makes the only decision he can\u2014to lead Britain into war and face the consequences.\n\nThe women are winning...\n\nThe queen, Morgan le Fey, is now the ruler of a kingdom of women\u2014half those in Britain are women, and the other half will follow her without question, if only just to keep their beloved home safe. Yet Morgan knows that the world is changing all around her, and the men must not be obliterated from history\u2014she's only one woman, no matter how wise. Her world, and the men who were its heroes, must not be forgotten.\n\nThe knights are winning...\n\nExcalibur may have fallen at the Battle of Camlann, but two swordsmen remain: Bedivere and Galahad. Galahad has taken on the role of fighting knight, and Bedivere is his closest friend\u2014but he knows it's only a temporary solution. The men, who could have saved Britain with the power their armies provided, must unite under a single leader to rebuild Britain's defenses.\n\nArthur is winning...\n\nBritain has endured two hundred years under Roman rule. Its roads are unravaged and roadsides bristle with plants and gardens. But Arthur knows things must be different, and he is right: the land will rise again if the men build it. Arthur will rebuild Britain. The last defender of Camelot is one Arthur cannot find.\nISBN: 978-1-4976-2582-4\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 by Larry Niven\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\n## The Last Defender of Camelot\n\nISBN: 978-1-4976-2582-4\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2015 by Larry Niven\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n \nThank you for downloading this Atria/Endeavor eBook.\n\n* * *\n\nSign up for our newsletter and receive special offers, access to bonus content, and info on the latest new releases and other great eBooks from Atria and Simon & Schuster.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP\n\nor visit us online to sign up at  \neBookNews.SimonandSchuster.com\n\nFor our daughter,  \nSamantha\nContents\n\n* * *\n\nPart One: The Wastelands\n\nThe New Year\n\nThe Hunted\n\nThe Gatherer\n\nThe Searchers\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nThe Roads\n\nThe Sanctum\n\nThe Eater\n\nThe Dead\n\nThe Sage\n\nThe Scorcher\n\nThe Maze\n\nThe War\n\nPart Two: The Citadel\n\nThe Taste\n\nThe Prey\n\nThe Children's Crusade\n\nThe Rip\n\nThe Aeronaut\n\nThe Sanctum\n\nThe Journey\n\nThe Sanctum\n\nThe Ritual\n\nThe Eater\n\nThe Eater\n\nThe Eater\n\nThe Eater\n\nPart Three: The Cure\n\nThe Wretched\n\nThe Ritual\n\nThe Sanctum\n\nThe Eater\n\nThe Eater\n\nThe Scorcher\n\nThe Cure\n\nThe Cure\n\nThe Sanctum\n\nThe Scorcher\n",

It's the same with me. I'm running and\u2014plop!\u2014I'm against this log....\n\nBut I could see from the boy's shoes that he was a runner, too.\n\nI was just about to leap to the other side when\u2014\n\nWhat's this?\n\nHe hasn't turned out to run away after all.\n\nWhat he's got on is a pair of skin-diving boots\u2014a Flatland boot that's got these kind of little hooks attached under the soles.\n\nHe dips his feet, the hooks catch\u2014and he's pulled along....\n\n\"Hey!\" I yelled. \"Hold up!\"\n\nWhat with one thing and another I'd forgotten how much I didn't want to be in this Flatland. The country was so flat, I kept saying over and over, and there didn't seem to be much to do but run. After a while my muscles just wouldn't move me any faster.\n\nBesides, this way I couldn't see nothing but sand and water, and the air wasn't doing the least bit toward cooling me off.\n\nIt was a relief when this boy shouted, too. \"Hey, kid, pull yourself together and get on the level!\"\n\nI looked around.\n\nThis log was the edge of a little sand-dune, and he was in the next one over.\n\nThat's how near he was, too\u2014even in my heavy-muscled Flatland.\n\nAfter a couple of breaths I got a grip and started climbing.\n\n\"Stop!\" I shouted. \"Can we\u2014?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"I'll show you the city gate.\"\n\nThe boy ran beside me. \"No need, kid; I know where we are.\"\n\nI stopped and looked at him.\n\nThat hair\u2014he must have got it from his mother\u2014and he was wearing a skin suit of gray like his hair.\n\nThen I thought my ears were playing tricks on me because his hair was so thick.\n\nThe more I looked at it, the more I knew it was really a lot like my hair.\n\nYou remember how my father had got his name, because he used to climb on the flat roof-top to get a good look at the stars?\n\nAnyway, that's what I looked like, too. My hair was straight and sort of curly at the same time, the same way his was, just a little longer.\n\nI know there's those scientists in Flatland who figured maybe people had moved around the old globe, and if so that makes it a new thing they call it\u2014\"evolution.\"\n\nBut I've always done things my own way, and I wasn't going to say anything, just yet.\n\nWhat with that hair and that skin suit that looked something like those gray camels I'd seen on the beaches, he could have been a full brother to me.\n\nAll the same, he was a lot bigger than me, and what with all his muscles moving up and down, and him walking a few steps ahead of me\u2014I thought maybe he belonged to the enemy.\n\nI know you should be able to have no trouble seeing right where you stand in a place like this. But something was making me have to look up.\n\nI was looking up now\u2014and in the sky was a whole crowd of small white clouds just floating along.\n\nIt seemed to me the only way they could have moved through the sky was up.\n\nI know, because I could see a tall man up top of this kind of flat roof, too.\n\nI'm telling you, he was going to climb up up up right on top of the clouds....\n\n\"Hey,\" I yelled, just the same as I had to the boy, \"stop!\"\n\nBut he didn't stop.\n\nHe just kind of swayed around, and one of his legs kind of slipped.\n\nThen he caught himself.\n\nAnd sure enough, what happened next, you'll be glad to know, was",

    "4": "\nFweepland is a fictional world, which Grampa has chosen to call Fweep because he cannot find an Earth name that will fit the setting.\n\nBut Fweep is a real character in a genuine story.\n\nOn page 588 of The Galaxy Book of Science Fiction, the introduction is the following:\n\nIn 1953, The Golden Egg was first published. But it's not the story as we know it, and if not for an odd, unforeseeably fortuitous twist, it most surely would never have reached its present readers.\n\n(It was published with a very different ending, where Earthmen make first contact with a race of \"blob-men\" who are being controlled by an AI.)\n\nFor centuries in human fiction, Earthmen\u2014and especially Earthmen with scientific minds\u2014have been struggling to understand non-human beings.\n\nScience-fiction writer James E. Gunn was a scientist himself.\n\nBut one day, he told an amusing anecdote:\n\n\"It was years ago while I was employed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, that I encountered my first non-human being. This was on a visit to Greenwich, Maine, as I was flying back to Washington after a meeting on scientific research problems raised by the coming moon-landings.\n\nWe were flying in our private aircraft when a heavy fog suddenly rolled in across the mouth of the Kennebec River and engulfed the plane.\n\nThe cabin lights were low at the time, and the fog was so thick that although the pilot's visor was clear, he had to feel his way with one hand on the instrument panel above his head. Although he knew we were in a single-engine, low-wing aircraft, he switched on his own light to make his position more visible at certain critical points along the river, especially when flying into towns.\n\nThere were several little towns spread out along the banks of the river, and each had its own lights: either street lights or floodlights for the riverside waterfront.\n\nI was sitting in the middle of the plane, my face shielded by my own goggles, and had not yet turned on my light.\n\nI was the only person in the front of the plane, and from where I was sitting, I had a grand view across the river to the woods and houses of a little, unnamed village.\n\nAs we passed over the last town, a series of spotlights suddenly illuminated the scene, and I suddenly felt my ears begin to ring.\n\nIn the dark cabin, I turned on my beam, and as the fog cleared momentarily, I saw four little spotlights like those that mark the approach to a town or city blazing ahead of us.\n\nFor a second I had no idea where these lights were coming from, and then I realized they were lights on the wings of a huge bird: an eagle.\n\nIt must have been a magnificent creature, almost three times the size of our small plane. It wasn't flying along the bank of the river; it was flying over our plane, only one wing tip in contact with the river.\n\nI was sure it wasn't an eagle. The eagle has large, sharp, talon-like claws in place of its hands.\n\nThis was a four-fingered bird, and the claws were as narrow and tapered as were the tips of a jet fighter plane.\n\nThese claws were long, and each one had a long, red, flickering light on them.\n\nThe bird was holding itself off the river in order to land, and the only way it could do this was to raise its wings higher and drag them down on the river.\n\nI could feel my mouth drop open as we passed by the huge bird, at an angle of twenty or thirty degrees.\n\nIt landed at the end of the last street and, almost casually, it lifted its wings again and walked down a short flight of steps into the city.\n\nNow I felt foolish because surely every human being in the front of that plane had heard the creature land.\n\nBut no one spoke a word, either of recognition, of surprise, or of alarm.\n\nI turned my light off; I didn't need it any longer.\n\nWe were gliding up and over the town now, and the bird, having disappeared into the fog, had left us alone once more.\n\nIt's a little anecdote in the larger whole, but it sums up better\u2014without even being a fair paraphrase of what the plane's pilot had told me\u2014than does the story of how, later, the blob-men appeared in The Golden Egg.\n\nFor the \"blob-men\" are not just any non-human beings\u2014or",

E. van Vogt when he wrote the story and is not found in the manuscript.\nThere are three kinds of people in the universe: the people who think they're right all the time and have no sense of humor at all, the people who think they're right all the time and have a sense of humor, and the people who never know they're right all the time until they look down from ten million miles above.\n\n\u2014Albert E. van Vogt\n\nA.E.VAN VOGT\n\nA. E. van Vogt (1912-2000) was one of the most original and acclaimed writers in science fiction for half a century. Often called the most important science fiction writer of the 1940s and 1950s, he was the first writer to write science fiction with the style of a detective novel. \"The Weapon\" (1945) was one of the most popular science fiction novels of the 1940s, influencing the development of the rocket-jockey subgenre. He had a great influence on the \"new wave\" writers of the 1960s, particularly John Brunner, and was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America, an award previously held by only Asimov and Heinlein. A prolific writer, his books include The Word, The Book, and the World; The War Against the Rull; The Bookmaker; The Voyage of the Space Beagle II; The Book of Skulls; The World of Null-A; Empire of Death; Slan; Necroscope; Precipice; The Vital Abyss; The Tubes of Orpheus; The Weapon; and the novels The Voyage of the Space Beagle and A Gift from Earth.

I mean real mysteries. I don't mean the kind of mystery I read in my books. There, the right name is a clue. In real life, real life is full of clues. And sometimes the clues are hidden even under the clues. That's why I've decided to write a book about mysteries. If I can learn to write a mystery story, it will make me better at solving real-life mysteries.\n\nI know you probably aren't the kind of person to read a book about mysteries. Everyone knows you're a very busy woman. I'm sure you're reading the mail even as I'm writing this letter. I could write up here in San Francisco, where I live, and then you could write back down in your office in Los Angeles, California. But that would be very boring. It would even get boring if you were here. What I really think is that we should share the writing.\n\nI have my own room at the top of our house, called a garret, so I can be by myself if I want to. Of course, if there really were a \"Mountaingree\" at the top of this house, I'd have to share it with a million squirrels and maybe even a skunk.\n\nI don't think a mystery story should be written in a fancy way in cursive writing with beautiful words. A mystery story should be written like you would talk if you were talking on the telephone, in big paragraphs. I don't even use commas or full stops in my writing. I think that kind of writing is for old people. And it would be very hard to write on this computer anyway because it's small and you have to use two hands to type anything. So all the time I'm writing this letter, I'll be doing what I've figured out is a good way to think about a mystery while I'm out walking in the Golden Gate Park.\n\nThis is what I've decided. There's a dead person in the park. There. I've said it. Now I'll tell you all the clues.\n\nThe dead person's name is Sven Lind",
    "7": "\nFweep, a cute little creature, could only be described as a little man, because nothing like a little man, but something between half a little man and half a glob of jelly, could have made that curious, transluscent creature.\n\nFweep is the Earthman's first alien. What's more, he is all that Earthmen would find on a new world if they never explored any of the other suns in the galaxies, and they were so fortunate as to find a place where the gravity is such that ordinary matter can make it from the sun to Earth, and gravity can't turn matter into energy.\n\nFweep would be a good name for the man who made the polarizer work by twisting the principles of gravitation into a simple form. Because Fweep is circular and makes the planet he occupies into a little globe, the little man is a good name for the man who first looked up into the sky and thought that he saw a little planet, the little planet he saw would be called the Earth.\n\nThe man who can make gravity bend around him is the first human to become larger than the planet his home world is on.\n\nThe human with no need for reproduction is the first to be as immortal as Fweep. Because he is immortal, he needs no woman for breeding.\n\n_The Sovereignty of Good_ \nTHE SOVEREIGNS ARE COMING\n\nLORRAINE HEATH\n\nTHE BERKLEY PUBLISHING GROUP\n\nPublished by the Penguin Group\n\nPenguin Group (USA) LLC\n\n375 Hudson Street, New York, New York 10014\n\nUSA \u2022 Canada \u2022 UK \u2022 Ireland \u2022 Australia \u2022 New Zealand \u2022 India \u2022 South Africa \u2022 China\n\npenguin.com\n\nA Penguin Random House Company\n\nFirst published by The Berkley Publishing Group\n\n(a) 2011\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 Barbara Barlowe\n\nPenguin supports copyright.

Note that it was not in the original issue of Galaxy.)\n\nMarian, the librarian who was to be his wife, came downstairs at ten to four on her half-holiday; and for nearly an hour she sat in the back of the library, smoking and sipping ginger ale while two men played chess. Finally, after he had gone, she finished the ginger ale, poured a stiff Scotch and went upstairs to change her stockings. The men did not start the second game until five-thirty, and Marian, who never went to the house during the day without a book, had left her own on a chair in the library, and she read most of a story by John Gunther before she realized that it was nearly six o'clock and time to go home.\n\nBut when she got home she still did not have time to take off the stockings, and when she was finally ready to leave for her date with Jimmie, the boy next door, it was after six-thirty and still raining, and the first thing she did was go over to the dresser and get a cigarette and smoke it, and she did not finish the story until the cab pulled up in front of the house on Broadway where she was to meet him.\n\nIt was seven-thirty and raining harder when they met, and on the way into the first movie Jimmie tried to make her laugh because she was laughing in all the wrong places, and she told him to stop being a child, and in the second one she told Jimmie to stop kissing her in all the wrong places, and he told her to stop being a woman, and she asked him to shut up, and then all three of them got in a fistfight on a bench in the park and broke Jimmie's nose. Jimmie and she drove to the house on Mulberry Street to try to talk it over, and by the time she got to Jimmie's apartment on Houston it was nearly one o'clock, and they were both drunk, and by the time she was sure he was going to be all right and not die she was so completely convinced that he was going to die that she did not notice it was raining again, and by the time she realized it was a fine warm night and that the last train had gone and that she had to go back to Mulberry Street with Jimmie in order to take a cab back to Broadway and get another cab back home, it was one-thirty and rainy, and she was so sure he would die that she did not notice it until she got to his apartment and looked out the window and saw it was raining, and the first thing she did was take the cigarette out of her mouth and go over to the dresser and get another cigarette, and she had only read a few lines of another story by John Gunther when Jimmie came into the bedroom and said no you're drunk and you know it and you've been drinking all day and you've been lying to me all day about having an important date and you didn't have a date with anyone today and I hate you, and he went back out into the living room to prove it, and she did not finish the next fifteen pages until after one o'clock.\n\nIt was three hours later when he woke her up to tell her that they were both too sick to get out of bed and that it was really pouring and that it was time to call it quits, and by four o'clock he had left and she still was half asleep, and she did not finish the story until after the last train and at least ten miles outside of Newark, Pennsylvania, and she got in a cab home just in time to meet Jimmie at nine-thirty, and they went out together to a cocktail lounge on East 36th, and then back to an apartment on First, and he let her take another cigarette off his dresser because he was drinking, and they spent the next half hour quarrelling and lying and kissing before she got enough of a headache to go to bed, and he said he had not been drinking, it was in her mind, and then he was very drunk, and finally he did a terrible thing in her bed that is hard to write about, and she took a cab home, and by the time she got back, only an hour or so",

To this we might be presumed to object that any explanation or even recognition of the motives would be simply an acceptance of the premise that in the first place we have any such thing to be explained or recognized. Indeed, if the reader wishes to know the real reason why certain kinds of fiction are written, and why this or that particular story came into existence, we feel that his question should be directed to the writer of other fiction of a similar or not similar flavor. Then at least he would have a chance to hear the writer's own story.\n\nSince I am interested only in presenting, not in interpreting, my own account of the origin of this volume, and since it might give a kind of value to the reader, should he ever find it, to know that I wish nothing from it, either value, recognition, or thanks, except the acknowledgment which his interest may in some way bring about, I will state that I started to write this book with the usual purpose of satisfying my ambition to achieve success enough to finance a proper house, and keep a carriage. And after writing it for a considerable time, perhaps because at some period in the composition it began to seem necessary to me to try to explain myself to myself, it was left unfinished\u2014a condition I trust will give some readers no objection, since they will no doubt consider it as much a piece of my usual bad luck that my books ever come to be published, if ever that happens. If this book ever finds a reader, such only as the reader is who believes that, unless every word of a book of fiction is strictly true and real, it should not be told, there is something in what I have written which will, in some way or other,",
    "10": "HOW TO MAKE FRIENDS\n\n(Galaxy Magazine, October 1962)\n\nQuestion:\nThere are three types of spaceship, which type of ship do you prefer?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI prefer orbital-type, geosynclinal-type, and geosynclinal.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the best part of being in space?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI like everything. Every part of space has some sort of beauty. That is what makes space what I call good. Every star has a beauty, a feeling. Of course, the feeling depends on the individual. It's something unique, something personal for everyone to experience themselves. The experience is different for each person. It is good in space.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIf you could be the pilot of any ship and have any ship's crew in the galaxy who could fly it, what would they be and what would you like them to do?\n\nAnswer:\nI wouldn't want a ship with only one crew. They always have a leader, but if they weren't leaders and each of them were an individual one of them would have no responsibility for his actions at all. Each of the people would have to take responsibility for the actions of the group. If the people were leaders and they were led, they could never know anything for certain. A leader cannot be happy with the knowledge, because a leader cannot be responsible. The crew must be led, and this must be done with trust, faith, and love.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIf you could select any five men in the Galaxy who you would always be with in space, living together, what would you pick and what would you like them to do?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI would select five men who would not fight. The five men would be the five I was traveling with in space. I wouldn't want a leader who thought he could know. I would select them on qualities of honesty, courage, trust, intelligence, and self-discipline. I would pick the five men for a purpose, or at least for a common purpose. A common purpose would be unity. It doesn't seem to be for the world to have unity. It doesn't seem to be worth unity. I think unity may be a man's purpose, or even to be found in it. I don't think a man is a planet. A man is his own world. If he was able to get this unity of purpose, or to be happy in the unity of purpose, and this is something that is common to him, he would want to be with the men that he could make this unity of purpose for the purpose of the world.\n\nThese are my beliefs about unity, but they are not the opinion of the U.S. government.\n\nQUESTION:\nWhat is your opinion about space?\n\nANSWER:\n\nThere are different parts of space. For example, if you had a desert, some parts of the desert would be cold and rainy. Other parts of the desert might be dry and hot. Then there would be areas with some variation in climate from place to place, so that even within the desert, there would be no complete predictability. A man in a spaceship must be prepared for all types of conditions, and he must use the proper knowledge of the conditions to survive in them. A man can't always rely on luck. He must know the different ways of getting along. The first part of knowing how to survive is to study and prepare yourself. If you understand the science, your chances of survival are much greater. For example, if a man is in space, he can use the radio to find out about the conditions in space. This is not luck, to read a book in space, that was published fifty years ago.\n\nThis is what makes man a thinker. This is what makes man not only human, but different from man.\nThis book is a manual for the spaceship.\n\nIt will instruct you on all the tricks of space travel and give you the knowledge to save yourself in the proper conditions of space survival. It is a manual for what you need to know about the different types of space travel. It will give you all the tips, such as how a spacecraft is built to move in space and how it is built in space to be comfortable during flight. It will teach you how the different types of spacecraft are built and how a human being might survive in space. How the spacecraft is built, which types of spacecraft are built, and which type of spacecraft are built that are most useful to the people of the earth will be explained in this book. This book will also explain why the different types of spacecraft should be built for space. This book will explain all these terms to the general public. The different types of spacecraft are:\n",

    "12": "\n\"Retief\" opens in the home domain of Retief, a very junior consular officer, who is on his first assignment away from Headquarters (where, according to his wife, he wastes his time). The title character is taken to Adobe, where at first he thinks the settlement is uninhabited. He soon discovers that the only inhabitants are a few terrainsettlers, who have been harassing the native inhabitants. Then Retief, working to the requirements of a strict set of instructions from Headquarters, does in fact achieve a rapprochement between the settler and native communities, but in an extremely novel style, and gets in the crosshairs in the bargain.\n\nNote:\n\n\"Retief\" is notable as one of the few stories of Laumer's career in which he used an existing planetary setting (the fictional Adobe) and a \"flipped\" view of events\u2014the Terrans being the aliens, not the terrainsettlers.\n\nNote:\n\nA story of an expedition to a world called Adobe and an effort to prevent a war between humans and non-human, the first-person narrative of his fellow officer, at the very least establishes Retief as a Laumer character who is more than a mere one-hit wonder (in \"Lazarus Long\" and \"Million Year Picnic\" for example). This story also marks the first appearance by Laumer of the Terran embassy on Ure, a setting that would not be extensively worked until much later, in the stories from his classic Starworlds series.\n\nNote:\n\nThis story was apparently the first Laumer story to be accepted by a high quality science fiction magazine, Galaxy, rather than appearing first as part of a collection; this fact was only recently discovered.\n\nNote:\n\nThe protagonist of the story was originally to be called Ralf Retief but this was changed to Rolf Retief.\n\nThe story makes references to the terraforming process which, at the time of publication, was still not generally known about.\n\"Retief of the Red-Tape Mountain\" was first published in 1963.\n\n### THE GOLDEN AGE   \nof LASERSHIPPING\n\n_Originally published in Galaxy Magazine, April 1963._\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nThis story is presented as it initially appeared in Galaxy Magazine.

Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.\n\nTranscriber's Note:\n\nExtensive research did not uncover evidence of the true author of this story.

He used his power to arrange for a diplomatic meeting with the flora. At the meeting he made a deal with the flora, though he used terms of enslavement\u2014he was talking about slavery\u2014to get the treaty signed.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the climax of the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe last part of the story took place at the Flapjack settlement. And it was a huge one, because the Flapjacks were very large and their leader could have swallowed Retief. So Retief left the meeting and went to arrange an exchange. He was the only human with a Flapjack on his shoulders. He bargained with the Flapjacks and got them to agree to exchange people from Earth for Flapjacks. Then he traded himself for some Flapjacks.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow is the ending different from the beginning of the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAll of a sudden in the middle the Flapjacks attacked the settlers. The only humans that came back the next morning were the ones who had escaped from the first battle. \n\n# THE GIRL ON THE PLATTFORM\n\nW.H. MENZIE\n\n## 1\n\nTHE girl was a little below the normal height for her age, but she was well filled out anyway, with healthy breasts and abundant hair. Her complexion was a good one\u2014not brown\u2014with no pink to it\u2014and it suited the dark blue of her eyes\u2014they were large without being too large\u2014and the expression in them was not without intelligence.\n\nWhen she walked with a slow-moving confidence that indicated youth, or when she sat as they sat with the others over the supper of bacon and tomatoes, and the beer, too, she looked neither pretty nor homely, but just healthy and at the beginning of womanhood. The youth had not yet left her, for she was still capable of the light-fingered movements, and the laughter, but it lay in her like a new suit of clothes\u2014and could be put on or left off as a lady desires, and the man knew that he ought not to watch her when her face was hidden by the hair.\n\nThat other man came into her mind, and she was aware of him, but she knew that he could not be expected to understand\u2014he knew so little\u2014and the man knew that she did not expect understanding. Now she went through the whole routine of the party with her, and they had talked together and eaten well, and they were playing cards with the rest, one side on the cards, and playing against the other. They were going to play till there was no more money in the room, and now the cards were in the fire and they were sitting there. Outside it was snowing, the wind blowing and the snow lying across the prairie. Now she came out of her chair and stood beside him.\n\n\"Don't sit still all night,\" she said. \"There must be someone outside with the car.\"\n\n\"I know them,\" he said, \"and they won't be here.\"\n\n\"You're always complaining that the car is stuck,\" she said. \"Now it might be here tonight. You just don't expect it.\"\n\n\"You don't know them. I know them.\" He pulled out of his chair and stood up.\n\n\"You don't know them. They got friends that will just let them sit all night. They don't care about anybody else's car.\"\n\n\"They got no friends,\" he said. \"I know them, all right.\"\n\nShe laughed scornfully.\n\n\"You know them. It's about time you knew some of those people. I've known them all my life.\"\n\n\"Who's been with you all your life?\" he said.\n\n\"Aunt Jane, for one,\" she said. \"And Uncle Dunc, and Aunt Ann, and Uncle Dick. And the rest of them. My father, of course, and Uncle Jim. What do you think I am?\"\n\n\"I thought\u2014,\" he began.\n\n\"My father? Why, he was all ready to go away, but Aunt Jane pulled him back and married Dad. And Uncle Jim\u2014I remember\u2014a lot of people were there for Jim. Aunt Ann\u2014I forget Jim's story\u2014and Uncle Dick.\"\n\n\"They're your relatives?\" he said. \"Here in town?\"\n\n\"What",

And his assignment to Adobe, an isolated backwater world, where even a few Terrestrials can stir up trouble with the indigenous natives, must be a very good choice indeed.\n   \n  \n  Retief arrives to find, by the best available information, that the Terrestrial settlers\u2014less than a handful of them\u2014have managed yet again to stir up trouble with the natives, and that retaliatory action is almost certainly needed.\n   \n  He requests the appropriate help from the Sector Chief, including the use of a few specialists in the field. The Sector Chief provides him with a consul who is sympathetic... and with sealed orders. The sealed orders have been worked out in detail at Sector, and Retief is expected to implement them to the letter.\n  \n  He proceeds to run into a few more local difficulties than he'd bargained for to handle this delicate situation, plus a few more unexpected developments along the way.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the story tell us about human nature?\n\nAnswer:\n  Retief of the Red Tape Mountain\n  by KEITH LAUMER\n\n   In a sense, all of us are Retiefs, in the sense that we all dislike getting personally involved in administrative or diplomatic maneuvering, even when we know this sort of stuff is very necessary. Also, we all like to make assumptions based on what we know on general principles, even when it may be wrong.\n\nQUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n**by Isaac Asimov**\n\n**1.** What is the plot of the short story \"Methuselah's Children?\"\n\nAnswer: The plot of \"Methuselah's Children\" is simple: a man finds a human skull in the Sahara, which must be several million years old.

But there is a deeper relationship as well that makes both a little happier and more contented. Old Lover-Girl has a tendency to get overpowered and she needs a strong arm to save her from herself. Strike's iron will and determination are exactly what she needs to keep her off the rocks.\n\nBOOK THREE:\n\nTHE TINY TATTLE-TALE\nCHAPTER FOUR:\n\nLOVE, VAMPIRES, AND SHOCKMEN\n\nGanymede to Mars\n\nStrykalski's first report upon relieving Admiral Gorman at Mars took over a page and a half in the ship's log. Strykalski's style was not to miss any of the incidents of the trip down to the Martian world. And there had been a number of them. For example, the Ganymede had to fight off a band of pirates as it left Venus. One would judge this to be an exceptional case in which the captain of a ship of the Combine would abandon the safety of a telluric orbit for one of a sun, but this was by no means the time for such caution. With Mars in opposition, the old monitor had been designed for a perihelion run. But during this phase of her career she had had a tendency to lose her equilibrium after a couple of weeks in space. The old monitor was a case in point. She was the only ship in her class and she had a certain pride of place in Naval history. She had to prove she could run the \"hot\" circuits. The Ganymede was the only telluric ship in Strike's fleet available for such a run, and her captain was a friend of the Commander-in-Chief, Great Solaria. There was no time to lose, and the Ganymede was all that stood between the telluric world and Gorman of the Inner Planet Fleet.\n\nStrykalski had to keep busy as Captain of an old monitor. His first act had been to assign half of his men and women to cleaning duties for a dozen hours a day. The crew was still filthy from the Venusport mud that the Ganymede had to fight through to lift. This duty was carried out by the personnel in turn, and at the end of each twelve hours each individual had to report that the ship had been thoroughly fouled back to her original condition. That is one of the ways to keep personnel busy. Then some of them were assigned to ship's routine.\n\nThe ship's routine consisted of a dozen hours every ten days on ship's routine. This was a period of about forty days, which the personnel took on ship's routine days. Ship's routine is a period of rest. It involved scrubbing and sweeping, some repair work, extra inspections, running of tests, and the like. That one of the greatest menaces in the Galaxy is to allow a spacecraft to run down and become as old and decrepit as some of those ancient battleships lost to Space War. This condition is apt to be more deadly and more destructive than any weapon or spacecraft in the war. All too many ancient battleships are the tombstones of more men and women who tried to hold Space War at bay for too long and too well.\n\nFor about twenty-five minutes of each hour they were actually at work, while the rest of each hour was spent in a period of recreation. These periods of recreation varied and there was a period of recreation every five hours or thereabouts in which the personnel ate one of the special meals that the ship could furnish in quantity.\n\nThis ration was considered to be very fine. It was a mixture of freeze-dried foods, with a little liquid (water) and a little of a sort of canned substance (a \"dining\" ration), all of these items carefully blended and then cooked. The cookery of any vessel depends on the ship it happens to be employed on and the equipment it happens to have on it. The cooking is accomplished by means such as of a microwave oven in a food-storage locker.\n\nThe ration was the same whether the personnel were on duty or on recreation. They would eat it from paper cups that were distributed to each man and woman when they ate.\n\nOne period of recreation was spent in each five hours of ship's routine. They had the use of some sort of a recreational area which was located at the end of the main passenger's corridor. This lounge was open at both ends and was big enough to hold comfortably about twenty people.\n\nThe officers would spend this period of recreation in their lounge, which was equipped with a small galley and had two or three beds and two or three cots.

That was about all that the other half of his face had left to it. One hand was paralyzed and the other hand was crippled with arthritis. His one eye was swollen shut, leaving only a small, dark, fathomless chink through which to view life. The nose was smashed; that was all he had left. His mouth was gone and his tongue gone. He had lost his voice and in its place was a small, round, wet hole that was always gushing. He could hardly draw a breath except through the hole. He could no longer speak but the gush of spit talked and he no longer had to breathe through the hole in his throat. He did not have to eat. He never wore clothes. His flesh had no need for garments, for the flesh was not what it used to be. He could now wear a long gown of tulle and he did. He could wear a tight hat shaped like the end of a Chinese pipe, and he did. He could wear a long coat of the most gorgeous scarlet and he did. He could wear a long coat made of soft blue fur or a beautiful coat of gray and black swirlies that made him almost a twin brother of the late and great Rudolph Valentino. He could put on a long black tunic, a white scarf over the shoulders, a long blue coat embroidered with gold thread and with black silk tassels, all of this being designed by Mariano Fortuny. He could wear a white cap, a black velvet cape lined with a thin silver strip and with gold clasps, his feet swathed in red velvet slippers that left his ankles bare. He could wear many hats and many coats. All of these he could hold up with a heavy gold chain on the back of his neck and that was the only thing left of all those who had come before. That and the gold chain. He was an antique. He was a museum piece. He was a corpse in a casket. He was a doll in a glass case. He was inanimate and unresponsive. For, as one who had risen to the pinnacle of fame and glory, he could not appreciate, he would not be impressed by, the unimportance which the critics and the world had given him. He was an egotist. One who had been a god on Olympus. One who had been a king when all the courts were open to him. He was a god and a king. One who had been worshipped and adored. One who had received the homage and the flatteries of all the adorers of the earth. One who had worn the mantle of a God and the chain, but in his eyes the gaudy robes were merely part of his costume. Nothing more or less than that he thought. The egotism knew no bounds. The world was merely a stage for the exhibition of his own magnificence. It was the stage of a theatrical production. One with a script prepared by his own hand.

    "18": "\nStrykalski's background\n\nStrykalski's a man out of tradition. His ancestors were all great sea-adventurers. His is a long line of officers. He's one of the \"good ones\" and, because of the background in which he was bred, he's also a good type. He wears the cross of the Tellurian Wing well. Tradition is part of him, but the sea is his love. And he comes by it honestly. In his bones. Strike comes from a long line of people who were born to be at home in a ship or on a beachfront.\n\nThe background of the spaceships\n\nThe early history of the universe, as far as is known, is that of a small, cool and beautiful planetoid which, from all indications, has been slowly drifting sunward. The planetoid in turn orbited a smaller sun, its own and probably its sun's companion. The sun grew, it seems, because of a slow infall of matter on the part of the larger solar system. And the small, cool planetoid grew too because its sun did. Thus there came a time when it was necessary for a world of molten lava to cool off... and grow large... so that it could support life.\n\nAt first, life was very little different from what it is now. Oceans of molten rock were, of course, devoid of life. But when life arose there, it was little different from the life that exists on our own planetoid today. The life of that first planetoid was, as history records it, primitive. Only after another million years, at the end of the Cambrian period, did life gain any sort of complexity at all. The reptilia appeared. The early mammals followed. And finally man appeared.\n\nSome time after man made his first appearance there was another major upheaval. And when it was over, life evolved into some of the complex forms which we are now privileged to witness. The reptilia died out. The early mammals died out. And the life of the planetoid settled down to the small changes that brought about the apes... then man.\n\nIn the year 1434, a great upheaval caused vast cracks in the crust of the planetoid. These cracks opened and the planetoid broke up into pieces. At that time, Venus and Mars were in opposition. And as the larger pieces of the planetoid separated there occurred a number of cataclysmic meteorite strikes. Such a period was called a \"solar storm\" of the \"O\" type. The solar storm of the \"O\" period was the last one known to science, and according to astronomers today, it was about one million years ago.\n\nThe three \"bolas\" (Scylla, Charybdis, Alcatraz ), built by the combined Solarian Navies, and still used for space travel, were the first real spaceships. There were other models, of course, which predate the \"bolas\" by thousands of years, but they were not suited for interplanetary travel. Space travel was in its incipient stages.\n\nLater on, when the \"bolas\" were built, there were many variations of the model. These were all used as space tanks and gun platforms in the Solarian Naval Wars, and most of them are now, in the years since, being replaced by newer models.\n\nWhen the Aphrodite was built, the ship was designed as a single vessel for the transportation of ore and personnel. She was later modified to carry both. Old Aphrodisiac is the last of the single-screw monitors.\n\nAlcatraz\n\nThe Alcatraz... named for the prison!\n\nAtropos and Lachesis\n\nThe Atropos and Lachesis ... the two Fates.\n \n# The  \nSavage Altar\n\n**A BookShots Original**\n\n# By Daniel  \nStashower**\n\nWith Introduction by  \nTed Kosmatka\n\n**Copyright**\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 Daniel Stashower\n\nIntroduction copyright \u00a9 2013 Ted Kosmatka\n\nAll rights reserved.

She had been designed as a monitor with a circuit to handle solar flare-ups in space, but was later refitted as a surge-circuit ship for deep space travel.\n\nB. With Mars in opposition and a perihelion run ahead of her, the ship had a lot of power for the job she was hired to do.\n\nC. She was an ancient vessel that had been in commission since the early days of the Solarian Combine and had already been to Perihelium and back at least once.\n\nD. A pilot and crew must have been sent to Venusport with the ship to operate her.\n\n2. What made Strike's eyes light up when he first saw Aphrodide?\n\nA. It reminded him of the sleek Ganymede.\n\nB. Old Aphrodisiac was a surge-circuit monitor with a hull of armored beryllium. With a hull like that, even at perihelion, Venusport Base was the limit of her range.\n\nC. Old Aphrodisiac was the flagship of Admiral Gorman, space commander of the Inner Planet Fleet. The Ganymede was a squadron monitor... and Strike would be back in the fight soon enough.\n\nD. He was relieved because the Gorman had been assigned to him.\n\n3. What did Strike know about his friend, Cob?\n\nA. He was an expert on Lover-Girl's operating controls.\n\nB. He was a senior lieutenant, and the ship's Executive.\n\nC. He was the Ganymede's former commanding officer.\n\nD. He came from an old Navy family.\n\n4. Why did Strike's eyes grow sad when he looked at the Aphrodite?\n\nA. Because he realized that the ship would probably be going nowhere but from Venusport Base to the nearest planet and back again.\n\nB. He thought of the Ganymede, which had been lost to him in the Procyon A Disaster.\n\nC. He had already made an ass of himself over a ship and could not afford a second such foolishness.\n\nD. He came of a long line of officers who got themselves discomfiled in the service of the Combine.\n\n\n\u00a9 2015 by Kari L. Hewson\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

    "22": "\nThe society was founded in the thirties as a nonpolitical pressure group to oppose, to the extent of nonviolent civil disobedience, any legislation designed to restrict Martian personal freedom.\n\nThe group began to expand into more and more profitable fields, including advertising, public relations, and espionage. There eventually developed a vicious internal rivalry among the top officers. Their power grew to a point where the Martian government had to be kept in order by a network of secret police authorities, the United Martian Security Council.\n\nBy the end of World War II, however, the Red Ankh was a national institution and its own police had become as powerful as the U.M.S.C. itself. As for the society's original objective\u2014a new wave of anti-tax propaganda, under-the-counter abortions and a nationwide lottery\u2014it had been completely accomplished.\nAuthor's Note\n\nI would like to thank Professor Algis Budrys of the University of Connecticut for permission to use his and his wife's story \"The Dancing Goddess of Zigota,\" as well as their permission to quote from it.\n\nThe story \"The Man from Teg\" was suggested by the fact that three of my own brothers, one living, two dead, were stationed for a brief time on Little Teg, one of the islands in British Guiana. The town of Teg is still there, the one-room schoolhouse, which I used as a model, not. The real schoolhouse had disappeared when I was a boy, but my grandfather had taught in it. I used one of my brothers' experiences to add detail to the scene in the story.\n\nAlso, as usual, I am very grateful to my brother, the great fan editor and bookman, Jack Rochowicz, for his advice and help.\nTHE   \nMAN   \nFROM   \nTEG\n\nBy James Blish\n\n[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Man from Teg by Pellegrino Ed.; The Science Fiction Writers of America, April 1963. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the Canadian copyright on this publication was renewed.]\n\nThe man from Teg...\n\nThe man from Teg walked the long hot day through creeper-grown jungles, over hills carpeted with mosses, through villages where the huts were no more than thatched roofs over mudbrick bases. The villages were dark in the hot sun, and when he passed through them the people turned back into the shade and looked like snakes.\n\nSometimes the man from Teg walked alone; sometimes he walked with other people. He never knew who they were, except that usually they were natives. He always suspected them of being natives.\n\nThey left him alone because he often had a gun under his armpit.\n\nOne of them had come out of the wall of a hut and shot him.\n\nIt seemed as if there were not many of the white men left in that country. The man from Teg walked alone because he was not with the others.\n\nIt was good to see them, the one-room schoolhouse where your brother taught them to read and write and do sums, the town where you and your brothers walked down the street and the women stared at you, the white man from Teg.\n\nIt had been good to see them at the beginning. Now it was not good.\n\nHe wondered where they had all gone to.\n\nHe wondered how you knew them. Was it always because they knew you? Or was it because they were white?\n\nHe knew the country where they lived. It was full of trees and green hills and streams where the water shimmered green. It had been good to see them then.\n\nBut now the white men were mostly dying, and those who were left were not with him.\n\nHis gun was under his armpit.\n\nSometimes at night he heard the drumming of the big birds overhead, and far off he heard the surf beating on sand. But those were not any good to him. None of them were any good to him.\n\nThe villages were dark.\n\nSometimes the man from Teg took his rifle out. He felt inside his jacket. The gun slid out smoothly on the leather strap. It looked very shiny. The man from Teg had cleaned and oiled it. In the white part of his mind it was said that he did not trust the natives.\n\nHe did not speak to the natives.\n\nHe did not sleep long any of the nights. If he could see any way out, he walked the night through the jungles and the hills. Or he would walk into the town with the night-lights in the buildings.\n",
    "23": "\nThe title of one of H. Beam Piper's most famous stories, written from the viewpoint of someone in the Martian underground.\n\nThis story is set in the world of his celebrated novel, Lord of the Trenchermen, and is an example of his wonderful satirical talents. In this novel, Piper portrays the Earthmen as grotesquely un-human, whereas here they are perfectly human.\n\nIt is also an example of H. Beam Piper's ability to create believable Martian characters.\n\nThe story's major problem is the presence of the Red Ankh; and yet without it, the story would be meaningless. The only reason we will ever hear of the Red Ankh is because it is such an extreme contrast to the Red Ankh Society. In the Red Ankh we meet the superbeing; in the Red Ankh Society, we find the superman. But why does their existence create this contrast? The answer is obvious: if the Red Ankh is a lie, then it proves that the Red Ankh Society is more truthful than it. The Red Ankh does not exist; therefore, the Red Ankh Society is the only true organization, the only honest organization. That is why, when the Red Ankh Society is revealed to us, it is such a surprise. We expect the Red Ankh to be a vast, elaborate hoax; it turns out to be an honest organization. From another viewpoint the Red Ankh Society is a fraud; from a third viewpoint, it is the real organization, to the extent that it doesn't exist.\n\nThe meaning of the Red Ankh is not immediately apparent; it is the contrast to the Red Ankh.\n  H. Beam Piper's stories often have a surprise ending that suggests several possibilities (see The End of the Matter, for instance). Here, a reader might suspect that the Red Ankh Society is the legitimate one, when in fact its name refers to the Red Ankh, the lie that the other two are based on. This would make it the honest one, as well. Since the Red Ankh Society is the only one that the Red Ankh itself admits to existing, it is probably the right one.\n\nIn this story of H. Beam Piper's, the reader cannot expect to understand the solution until the end. It comes only because the author doesn't consider his audience stupid.\n  When a lie is proven by the Red Ankh Society, it is only in reference to the Red Ankh Society. The lie itself is not proven.\n\nThere is a paradox in the fact that the Red Ankh Society is the only organization that does not exist. If there is no such organization, then why does the Red Ankh Society mention it? The reason is the same one that would cause you to notice something falling from a roof that you had not noticed before. If you don't look at what is falling, then it does not exist. This is all a metaphor, though, and it has nothing to do with metaphorical language.\n\nIn this story we learn that the Red Ankh is merely an example of metaphor. The lie is the metaphorical expression \"I am bigger and stronger than thou, the human being,\" which is what the Red Ankh is in the preceding paragraph.\n\nThe Red Ankh Society is based on the metaphor of a lie, and it is only there to prove the actuality (or at least the reality) of metaphor.\n\nIn this story, H. Beam Piper gives the reader three views (or three questions to ask) about a lie.\n\nOne of those questions can be translated to say that the Red Ankh Society is not a lie.\n\nIt is also the name of the story. Or more precisely, to say that we are the only ones who will ever read the story. That was the same viewpoint from which the question was asked, that this is the only story by H. Beam Piper, of that name, but it is the same viewpoint from which the title was asked, that there are other stories by the same author, but they are not of that name. This is why it is the same viewpoint from which the question about the Red Ankh was asked as the viewpoint from which the title was. That is why the author puts these question marks in parentheses around the answer, because they don't ask for an answer. For them to ask for an answer is just a different question from that question when he asks \"Is the Red Ankh Society a lie?,\" because now there are three, one for each question mark. The first question is about the Red Ankh Society; the second is about whether the Red Ankh Society is of that name or is also of other names; the third is about whether there are other names",
    "24": "\nThe technique is known among psychodynamicists as the \"contact trace.\" Granthan, like anyone, possesses the ability to reach out through subconsciously selected associations and connect spontaneously with an object of his mind, so long as the object is within his range of awareness.\n\nThe trick of the psychodynamicists was to program such a connection. Granthan, in response to a simulated attack by the Gool, set up the necessary patterns.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy does Granthan wait until he's home and \"resting\" before calling Kayle?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt was essential, now that Granthan knew he was being used by the aliens, to persuade Kayle of his continuing allegiance to the \"home team.\" By acting calmly rather than being hysterical, he hopes to gain time for his plan to make use of the information he has stolen. Kayle will wait a logical interval for a report from an apparently undisturbed Granthan.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIf the Gool have a contact trace, why can't Earthmen pick up their \"thought-messages\" in the same way?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBecause, unlike Granthan, an unconsciously trained alien operator would have to be at a more profound level of contact.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow does Granthan know there won't be other survivors of Belshazzar when Gilgamesh is struck?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe answer lies, not in the ability of the Gool to maintain a secret mental connection, but in their having deliberately avoided contact with the Earthmen.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy does Granthan allow the lifeboat to burn up rather than make an attempt to land?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Gool would certainly have been aware of Granthan's presence on the boat. The Gool, like many other aliens as well as humans, are reluctant to enter the minds of their enemies.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow does Granthan know that the lifeboat will be destroyed in one hour if Kayle doesn't call off his missiles?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDuring the night, there was a series of reports over a shortwave net on the probable locations of the lifeboats. Kayle listened to the final report of an Air Force crew that had spotted flames in the vicinity of Belshazzar. Then he called his own report in, a report stating that he was monitoring the lifeboats as they went down, and he had not sighted any lifeboats. This, he believed, was enough to convince his superiors that he was acting in the best interests of the fleet at large.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy does Granthan think Kayle hasn't yet reported the lifeboats on Earth?\n\nAnswer:\n\nKayle is still in a state of shock after the attack. He is trying to determine on exactly what information he should base his next move. In the meantime, Granthan figures the Gool would have no hesitation in sending additional missiles toward the lifeboats even though at least some Earthmen might be on their way home.\n\nI did not write this story. It was brought to me with the request that I \"fix\" it up for publication. I don't like having to do such jobs but it has happened before and will no doubt happen again, so I have no illusions on the subject.\n\nThe original had some of the clich\u00e9s of the space opera\u2014space and time are interchangeable in my universe\u2014but as I read it, I saw that the idea behind was fairly good. The writer, a newcomer who hadn't developed his point of view on writing, could not seem to come up with his own way of building up a story. Hence his reliance on the \"tried and true\"\u2014spaceships, explosions, aliens. I couldn't very well see any flaws in the premise, though it has been done before\u2014who does remember the old science-fiction tales of Paul Ernst? His stuff was far superior to the current fare, which generally bores me to the point of not wanting to read it. This writer, too, was better than the norm but had not yet found his own angle of attack.\n\nSo I thought I'd apply my own peculiar approach to it. I tried to work out the situation through the point of view of one of the characters. The story came over to me by telegraph wire in manuscript form, which makes it difficult for a modern editor to alter it without damaging the author's own \"vision\" of the story. So I did the best I could, as I recall. What the reader sees below is my story; for the original see the Introduction to this collection. For further information see the Author's Note at the end.\n\nBy WINTERS UN-MARTIN\n\nI\n\nThere are three",
    "25": "\"I watched the Gool mind, and learned it.\n\n\"I'd seen how the Gool mind controlled me as I stood helpless at the escape hatch of Belshazzar. I had gone through the crisis of contact with a mind so monstrous, so utterly alien. I'd had a direct contact with the mind of another sentient being.\n\n\"It had been my responsibility to learn as much as possible under the circumstances. It seemed that, if it had been possible for the Gool to control my actions while I was unconscious, the next day I could learn their technique.\n\n\"If I could do that, I might be able to do something about Granthan.\n\n\"I couldn't wait for him to wake up, stumbling through the shock-trauma and the pain of his burns. I had to be in control. Not he, but I who acted for him.\n\n\"So I lay back, took deep breaths, let the subconscious seethe. I keyed the trigger word, slipped into the nebulous emptiness of a first-level trance.\n\n\"I tried to keep my inner self steady, not tense, though it raged to plunge into that dream-land of hallucination, to feel the touch of the alien mind.\n\n\"I sank closer. Into that world of phantasmagoria I probed. I went deeper. I broke through into the hallucinatory third level.\n\n\"And there it was!\n\n\"There was the pattern of a mind-pattern, a pattern that I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had been done to me.\n\n\"Instantly, a channel was open.\n\n\"As easily as I have raised my hand to pluck a flower from a night-blooming tree, I reached into the unspace between the stars, and took hold of a black-hot world.\n\n\"The Gool mind had been there.\n\n\"And while it still fatted itself on the slaughtered flesh of the prime enemy world, I struck.\n\n\"Without pause I clamped down the outcry, reached out into that obscene gelatinous immensity, and took my grip.\n\n\"The Gool mind collapsed.\n\n\"Not pausing, I followed up, probed along the pattern, traced for patterns, scanned the flaccid Gool mind.\n\n\"I found myself in a pit of living yellow flesh, in a sea of liquid sulphur.\n\n\"There was a fuming pit where sulphur bubbled up from some inner source and filled an immense natural basin.\n\n\"I saw the great cables, the living nervous tissue that connected each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground.\n\n\"I saw the strange devices built by the Goul in the caverns where the suckling spawn labored.\n\n\"I touched them with my mind. I felt the life-sap of the young Gool.\n\n\"I held that pattern in empty space, probing into their mind, exploring their thought-receptacles.\n\n\"The thought-receptacles of the Goul.\n\n\"The patterns within patterns.\n\n\"The circuits of thought-patterns.\n\n\"I followed their logic-sequence, let the exploding of their meaning whirl like a bomb-burst.\n\n\"I saw how a Goul would make a worm-world, how in the endlessness of space\u2014there was a point, where a worm-world must not be a world of stars but a world of stars\u2014the worm-world could be made a worm-world.\n\n\"I saw how it could be done.\n\n\"A worm-world.\n\n\"Matter across space.\n\n\"I knew the words to say.\n\n\"I knew what had to be done.\n\n\"I spoke them and gave the orders.\n\n\"The Goul were my enemies, yes. But there was no question. Not at the cost of humanity's hope. I had been too close to know what the Goul were.

I would learn what I could, first of all to set a decoy within them.\n\n\"I would keep my fingers on their weapons. If it came to that. They were a thousand years in advance of us.\n\n\"But it was a matter of years now, not decades.\n\n\"I would not let the Goul control me.\n\n\"I moved back from the pattern I had plucked, scanned it carefully.\n\n\"I closed the",
    "26": "\nBy deliberately imitating the Gool's mind control technique, and even surpassing it in power. In the first place, Granthan's training enables him to set up his own decoy personality, which is extremely effective in blocking the Gool's probe and causing Granthan to survive the attack. When the probe penetrates, Granthan copies it, creating for himself a channel of communication with the Gool spy, so that he can interrogate it on its habits. Finally, Granthan uses the Gool's technique of matter transmission to transmit matter across space, transmitting the vital information back to Earth.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the significance of the Gool's name and of their worship of the Effulgent One?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBy using a highly developed sense of smell, and a natural immunity to the poisonous atmosphere of their environment, the Gool have perfected the technique of matter transmission. The term Effulgent One, which is used to designate the Overlord, is a reference to their name for matter transmission, which transmits matter out of the body to the food-creatures\u2014the gorm-worms.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat does the Gool eat?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDuring the day, they feed upon the gorm-worms; at night, they feed on each other. The Effulgent One, the Overlord, eats on the day of rest, and is, therefore, the supreme figure in Gool religion.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWho are the Gool, and what do they worship?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Gool are monstrous insect-like creatures having four eyes, legs, mouthparts, and a brain-mass. They worship the Effulgence. Matter transmission is their method of communicating with the Effulgence, and their method of propelling their fleet.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow did the Gool get to Jupiter II?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Gool originally come to Jupiter II from Taurus II. However, they were forced to seek out more appropriate conditions because of diminishing supplies of food. The term \"Starfolk,\" which is used to name the Gool, is a reference to the star which gives them matter to fuel their ships.\n\nQuestion:\n\nDescribe the lifeboat. How many couches are aboard? How many does Granthan lose? How did Granthan come by the burns?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe lifeboat carries the crew and passengers in a dozen high-speed passenger pods that would carry the passengers almost all the way to Earth. Each of the pods has an enclosed, two-person lounge and a bed. Four of the pods were aboard the lifeboat; Granthan manages to get clear of the wreck, but his leg is crushed and his right arm is burned. The lifeboat was not equipped to support a sick man, so he tries to crawl through smoke into the escape hatch. He gets the burned arm in the hatch, but the leg prevents him from proceeding. He is then hit by the escaping lifeboat, which breaks his leg and damages his right arm.\n\nQuestion:\n\nAfter Granthan gets out of contact with the Gool, what does he do? Where does he go?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAfter he gets out of contact with the Gool, he returns by himself to his home, the CCC. In the meantime, he dreams that he is swimming in a river of white fire; and that he can't get away from it.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhen Granthan does awaken, where is he? What is his condition?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWhen Granthan awakes, he is on the floor of the lifeboat cabin next to an acceleration couch. His left leg is in a walking brace, and the leg is broken. The right arm is scarred and burnt. He is still weak, but he makes his way to the first-aid cabinet. He thinks the worst will be over pretty quick, but the leg is broken and will have to be set, and his arm has to have the burns treated.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow does Granthan proceed on to Earth?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAfter Granthan has fixed his leg and arm, he attempts to make a call to Earth. Kayle, who is the base commander, refuses to let him enter the atmosphere.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is Granthan's feeling?\n\nAnswer:\n\nKaylee insists that Granthan's presence is too dangerous to the war effort and not worthy of his patriotism. While Granthan is trying to get in touch with Kaylee, Kayle's wife telephones and she is very angry at him. Granthan is depressed and wishes he could get back to Earth somehow.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow does",

He made things for them, too. Preservatives, blood-pumps, and then he shipped them to the green earth. Sometimes an officer of Mars, or Venus would get in his way, and Burnett would have to kill him. A hundred ways of dying. No two were ever the same; that was what made it so funny. Sam Burnett wasn't so very old, but the job was boring.\n\nHe found the men like this: on the stars where they had drifted for hundreds of thousands of years, or at the end of long orbits, or in the shadow of other ships, or in the trails of dying rockets, or on the surface of enemy battle sites, or in the throes of an accident. Sometimes they were so close that Burnett had to take them away through the star-port, with the claw, and he had to see their names, and if they were young he didn't know how to feel and he might break down.\n\nThere were times when he would find a body that was not at all dead, with its eyes staring, still living. Once a soldier came aboard who really was burned alive, and when it happened Burnett wept and screamed, and the war was the only one he could think about, and afterwards he thought of all the other bodies who never looked like that again.\n\nIt got so the war was all he thought of, and one day they found a man with a piece of the battle-cruiser floating around him, and he was quite dead. There were a lot of bodies without a ship in sight, and sometimes those were the easiest to pick up, because they were already preserved. Sam Burnett didn't know where all these men came from, and sometimes he wondered why they had died.\n\nRice found it all rather confusing, because the war was supposed to be over, and this was after. Burnett didn't want Rice to know why he went on doing his work. It was the war they were talking about. And it was Burnett who always went back and forth to Mars and Venus, and Rice just stayed on the morgue ship. Burnett would have liked to get through his job and go back home.\n\nRice had been with him ten years, and no one else had ever come on board the ship. He was older then this Rice, and older now. Ten years of carrying bodies, and one hundred thousand bodies had been on the shelves when he quit. It was something he was not going to forget, but he couldn't remember why. But that didn't stop him.\n\nBurnett took the bodies to the laboratory to begin with, and then he began to ship them back to Mars and Venus. He didn't know why he picked up so many bodies, or what the war was like, or any of the things that happened to him. That was all back home. Burnett liked to think about going home, and he liked not thinking any longer about all those bodies that had come aboard to be stowed away. Rice used to wonder about it, too.\n\nOne hundred, and so many times, so many nights, going back and forth, back and forth, through the endless air-lock corridors of space. Two men: Rice and himself: all alone, only two men were left alive. The other hundred thousand were all dead. You couldn't really see them, though. They were all in the air-lock now, up high, where they never talked. All of them were dead.\n\nBurnett knew when the war was over. There had been all sort of battles and fights and cruisers dying and then Burnett knew that it had begun to go back where it came from, where the war started. He didn't know that he would see that last thing again, because the stars were all still shining, and space was still alive. The Constellation was heading for home.\n\nAnd in the end, there was nothing left, not even a lot of star-pocked bodies with blood cooling in their veins. Burnett wasn't going to forget it, or he would have forgotten all the other things as well. He could still remember everything. And it was all back home.\n\nAfter ten years of running, with Kriere and Lethla, he took the first trip to his real home, and he didn't have to make any more trips. He was going to leave the others alone, the ones he had never seen, and he could go home.\n\nBurnett didn't think of the last time. And he thought of it the same way Rice did.",

W. Larkins\n\nRay Bradbury is a true original. A story as fine as this takes talent, inspiration, imagination, and a bit of luck into the bargain, and that describes Bradbury to the bone. The story that he contributed to Planet Stories for the October 1943 issue was the first of a series dealing with the great age of giants among men. I must say that, if I am to criticize, I must also speak out with regard to his technique. Bradbury is definitely one of those writers who don't write down to kids (they'll read it anyway), but rather write to his own level, which unfortunately doesn't always mean my level. If you don't know and love Bradbury's works, read this story now, and then go out and find some. It will be worth your time, and may inspire you to write and read.\n\n\u2014S. W. Larkins\n\nOriginally written for \"Planet Stories\" in 1943, this is a story of alien plants, human bodies, and the strange, mysterious planet of Venus.\n\nThe story begins in deep space when a Venusian spaceship is forced to land on Earth because of battle damage:\n\nA great, round, dark face hovered beside their starboard fuselage, one eye like a red diamond, the other blue and milky, blinking like an unhappy baby.\n\n\"Our ship is disabled in Venusian space. We have suffered battle damage. The pilots and I will land for repairs; the remainder of our company here are being dropped as lifeboats. Take care of them in a humanitarian manner.\" It said the last with such a tone of absolute authority that the three men standing in the open port, staring at the Venusian in amazement, forgot to answer.\n\nAboard the Constellation they are confronted by, among other things, a corpse. When a body is brought aboard the ship, many questions arise: Who was it? How did it get to Venus? Why did it land on Earth? The body must be studied, but first a question must be asked, which is \"What in hell has happened to this man?\" He is found frozen and stiff, as if he were dead, but it is hard to know if this is a fact or a lie. After all, his skin is too thick, his muscles too powerful, and he is still a Venusian, not just a dead man. The three people on the Constellation\u2014Burnett, Rice, and Jorgins\u2014decide that the Venusian must be the body of Lethla, a member of his army, a guard on his life, the majordomo of Prince Kriere, \"The All-Mighty\" of Venusoid Venus. They want to do him good on Earth. It is their job to perform, but what a job it is.\n\nBefore they leave Earth, Jorgins is asked to pilot the Morgue Rocket to Venus and to take his chances of making it across the space-crushed hulls:\n\n\"That's crazy, Jorgins,\" Sam Burnett said slowly. \"In those ships there's only one chance for survival, or for death. That kind of death you don't like when you're alive, son.\"\n\nSam and Rice stood in the air lock of the Constellation, watching Jorgins, who had gone into the life raft as if he walked over a pile of pillows. Lethla and a few more were being launched as a matter of course, but Jorgins was going to pilot the morgue ship to Venus.\n\nNow Sam and Rice were going back to Earth. There would be three more shelves to fill with space-slain warriors\u2014and he would be among the living again...\n\n...Moving the ship...\"Extending the retriever claw...\"Plucking some poor warrior's body out of the void.\n\nThe three people on the Constellation were given",
    "30": "\nSam Burnett did the most important job in space. The Morgue Ship was a battle-scow; it picked up warriors from battle zones; and brought them back to the home planet for decent burial. Its passengers were as far removed from everyday life as the sun is. Its pilot, Sam Burnett, was a man in his mid sixties. His job was to examine bodies from the war to make sure that they had died from injuries and exhaustion, not death by torture. He was a quiet, lonely old man who got his job after the war, and when the war was over, Burnett had to be on the job for another decade.\n\nBurnett made all the necessary tests, and then the bodies were stored in the morgue. It was very quiet on the ship, just like when Burnett was on Earth, and then he was in charge of those shelves. And he waited for people to die by war.\n\nSometimes it took a while to find the right person.\n\nAnd Burnett was an expert at reading faces.\n\nThe body was lying face down on the transparent table. It looked like a man's, but its expression didn't look human. There was a huge scar on its face that Burnett was sure would be difficult to remove. He checked the name tag which said: RAYBRODYN, SPACE BUREAU. It might be dangerous to take this man home to bury if Raybodyn was still alive.\n\nBurnett picked up his tool. He pressed it into the scar with a sharp blow. It ripped through the flesh. Then another, and another, until the scar was ripped off the guy's face. A red mass flopped onto the transparent table in the next few seconds. Burnett's face seemed to be floating through the air looking at the new body. He got a new scalpel out and started to remove the flesh.\n\n\"I don't like this,\" he told himself.\n\nThe man on the table was still breathing.\n\nIts blue eyes stared at him as if accusing him of something. As if it were dead and was having a bad dream.\n\nBurnett did the same as before, only it seemed as if that time it was more dangerous to pull the flesh off the body like it was nothing more than a big wound. The man looked exactly like a warrior with the war goggles strapped on its head and the muscles tensed to fight.\n\nThe goggles were cracked in the front and the eyes were bluish blue and staring through Burnett.\n\nHe looked at the body a little longer but decided that it was still alive and he had better take it home to bury.\n\nThen Lethla stepped into the air-lock. He was a skinny, longhaired man of twenty-two, all in black leather, carrying a gun.\n\n\"Lethla,\" he told himself.\n\nHe never had liked this man.\n\nLethla seemed to be all smiles and nice but had a cruel mind and seemed to think he could get away with murder.\n\nEvery time Burnett saw this man he felt as if his stomach was about to come loose right after he had eaten.\n\nBurnett looked at Lethla and nodded at him, ready to pick up the dead body and go back to his job.\n\n\"It's an old one, Burnett,\" Lethla told Burnett.\n\n\"I'll send an inter-ship code,\" Burnett said and nodded.\n\nWhile Burnett was working with the body, the Constellation was picking up and bringing into the ship the next body.\n\n\"I don't like the way this war is going,\" Lethla complained.\n\n\"We're in luck,\" said Sam Burnett.\n\nEven though this might be his last trip to Venus, Burnett didn't try to escape. It looked as if Lethla wanted to get out but needed a gunman to help him escape.\n\nBurnett was sure that Lethla was going to Venus to find Kriere, but Burnett hated to have one of his passengers be a murderer.\n\nSam Burnett had spent three thousand days and nights going to Venus and coming back to the home planet with bodies for proper burial. Lethla seemed to be going to Venus for no reason. It was just that Burnett was sure that Lethla did not want to return to home. Maybe he was going to Venus to try to rule Venus. Sam Burnett thought Lethla looked like a kind of prince of some sort, but he didn't know that he would be such an ambitious boy, thinking his life was better than anyone else's.\n\nBurnett didn't like him a bit.\n\nHe looked at L",

I am a mortal woman, a mother and a healer\u2014a woman with the strength of my heart and the wits of my brain. I have no powers, I have no spells._\n\n_I am not a witch._\n\n_Some of you call me a wizard, but there were no wizards in my village. Even those who believed in magic, who went off to hunt for lost rings in the forests, who called_ kelte _the spirit of a magical stone, did so in ignorance. They knew nothing of where magic truly came from._\n\n_I am Maeve, the one who holds the spell of healing._\n\nThis much I was certain of. I am not a wizard in any sense of the word. I am a woman, strong willed and brave, and if you ask me this again, I will hit my palm against my breast and I will growl that I am a woman with the strength of my heart and the wits of my brain.\n\nI am a healer. That is my true power, for I believe in healing, I believe in the simple kindness and friendship of a warm hand in the dark, a cup of tea shared by the fire's dying coals. I never had a magic spell to fall back on. I did not use potions and charms to coax the soul from a dying man, or the spark to a dying heart into some life-giving spark. I never knew the secrets of a spell.\n\nI do not know the secrets of a spell. No, not really. But the spells of healing, I swear to you, are as potent a magic as any spell. And that is my magic. The Healer is the greatest of spells. For me, that is the true magic and it remains my magic, always.\n\nThis was how magic began, with love; it was with love that magic started its long death-song in the world, and with love that magic has fallen to sleep and lain dreaming of some dream\u2014\n\n\u2014and I am no witch.\n\nThere was magic, once in this land. It is true enough; we are the keepers of the tales, we, the women in the mountains to the south, the ones who hold to the old",
    "32": "\nFweep is a circular polarizer. It can bend the laws of gravity around him and protect itself and others from the power of gravity, keeping the inhabitants of the flivver from being crushed when the spaceship slows from too much velocity. However, the polarizer cannot make the ship go up again. This is because Fweep likes the gravity he's experienced all his life, on his own planet, and he's reluctant to change it. At intervals when Fweep has lived there long enough to allow nature to produce a suitable mate for himself, he and the female will breed, then Fweep's body will be a temporary nest for the offspring as the young ones feed on the male. Once the offspring is old enough to live on its own, Fweep will eat the young as he otherwise eats his food, then leave it to its own devices until it too reproduces. In doing this and, if necessary, leaving the new creature outside to start over again, Fweep prolongs the life of the species and guarantees an eternity of peace to his territory, for it is his duty to protect the young and provide a habitat for its survival. He's done this for many aeons and he won't willingly relinquish this duty simply because humanity has now come and taken Four from him.\n\nFour is therefore forced to stay with Fweep until he grows old enough to leave with his future wife. He seems to realize this and is at peace with it.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy does Fweep like gravity that's polarized in a circle?\n\nAnswer:\n\nFweep is a creature of the Planet Four, and his people have lived in Four's gravity all their lives, as is the human crew.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy does Fweep protect the Peppergrass?\n\nAnswer:\n\nFweep does all this because he loves Four and would rather stay on Four's planet and look after him than return to a more populous, perhaps less attractive and welcoming Earth.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy does Fweep refuse to let the Polarizer work?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn ordinary space, gravity takes the form of lines. Fweep would rather experience it as circles, not rectangles or irregular curves. He is also a creature of habit, and change is unsettling for him.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is Fweep's native language?\n\nAnswer:\n\nFweep's native language is \"Fweeph-tweet\". Four's is \"Earthspeak\".\n\nQuestion:\n\nIs Fweep intelligent and sentient?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWith his gravity field and a few simple organisms that Fweep likes to nibble now and again and a language of their own, Fweep and his people are so far as possible self-sustaining, and thus they are by a certain standard sentient and intelligent. However, Fweep is not self-reflecting, and it is not considered intelligent in a sense to judge by the standards of Earth.\n\nQuestion:\n\nDo all of the Fweep have a sense of humor?\n\nAnswer:\n\nFour senses a certain humor in Fweep as he has in himself, but it is not in any sense shared by Fweep or his entire race. And Fweep himself, while fond of Four and willing to do anything for his benefit and the benefit of his family, is serious about his task and won't easily be coerced into granting any favors to mankind.\n\nQuestion:\n\nCan the Peppergrass leave with Fweep if they are able to persuade Fweep to abandon his habits to let the polarizer work?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThey could, but Fweep is the only Fweep they've met, and he is not really aware of any other Fweap beyond himself. He and his kind represent the limits of Fweep's understanding of the Universe.\n\nQuestion:\n\nCan Fweep be reasoned with and persuaded to change his ways?\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, he is as much a part of gravity and space-time as are the stars and planets and he is not of a mind to turn aside from that which he considers proper.\n\nQuestion:\n\nCan Fweep be converted to see things as they are in the eyes of man?\n\nAnswer:\n\nPerhaps, but only through Four's gentle persuasion, for Fweep as a rule does not think about human matters, not being naturally inclined to such things. He is concerned only with his survival and that of those things that are natural-born to him. This makes Fweep something of a primitive.\n\nQuestion:\n\nCan Fweep be converted",
    "33": "The first words of the story, the description of the spaceship, and the first person POV all show that Four is the protagonist. There is no mention of the other three members of the family, only Four. This is supported by his POV throughout the story. The second and third person POVs are from Grampa and from Junior (who turns out to be the narrator later).\n\nThis is significant because it shows that Four doesn't just appear to be the main protagonist, he is the protagonist. He is the character who dominates the story (and the family); therefore, he is the protagonist.\n\n\"I am Four:  \nNo more, no less.\n    I am a piece of string  \nWith darning needle in the end.\"\n\n(from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner)\n\nThe narrator of \"Four\" is the narrator of most stories; the exception is the first person POV of \"The Most Dangerous Game\" by Richard Connell which is written like a first person report or monologue.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does Four want?\n\nAnswer:\nThe answer may lie in asking what he wants for others. He wants the \"people\" to have what he does not.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy can't he have it?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt is implied in the story that the reason people must \"have things\" is because they cannot \"be things.\"\nBy what devices is the story told?\n\nBy what devices is the story told?\n\nBy what devices is the story told?\n\n\"Four\" is told through stream of consciousness; it tells things as Four sees them. Four is the type of narrator who often appears throughout novels in particular who, like a first person narrator, narrates from his own point of view. He sees himself as the problem solver, the solution to the other three characters' problems: Grampa, Fred, and Joyce.\n\n\"Four\" is unusual in this way of narration in that it uses the viewpoint of a first person narrator in a third person narrative. This means that Four is not only the main protagonist, but also that he understands the problem from all sides.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy do none of the characters like Four?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBecause Four does not really try to be anything he is not, he also does not try to act like anyone he is not. He is a simple character.\n\nFrom what planet or star does the story originate?\n\nThe story originates on a planet circling a suns whose color the story provides only a rough indication: old; orange.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does it represent?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWhat one planet means also applies to any planet, that being that it is not Earth.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the main message of the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThat people would rather be things than have things.\n\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 by The Literary Guild.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Gunn\n\n THE GRAVITY BUSINESS.\n\nA Prologue.\n\nFour Earth years ago.\n\nThere is a small, white-haired man named Grampa Peppergrass who calls himself a \"tinkerer.\" He is not much over ninety, but his hair is white and his face shows only a few lines of time, his ears are small and his hands are large and knobby. His face shows only a few lines of time.\n\nHe has many curious gadgets and some of them are so strange that science fiction writers have used them as models for their stories. The Gravity Machine (popularly known as the Polarizer) and the Space Flivver are two such models.\n\nA year ago, Grampa Peppergrass bought a sixteenth share of a space-flivver. Then he had these gadgets stolen by a gang from the New Mexico desert (for he had become a millionaire and all his money was in bank accounts in Earth). He went to Earth and he found himself a young son and a pretty daughter. The son was called Junior, the daughter was called Joyce. He gave them the flivver. Then he went to work on the Gravity Machine and built the pircuit that operates it.\n\nFour days ago.\n\nThe pircuit was a box with thirteen holes in it and a lever. If it was the player in turn, he could knock out one of the holes by pressing a button. The polarizer was a black cube, which covered ten square feet and was operated by the lever of the pircuit. The only use the pircuit was to turn on and off the gravity, which is polarizing. The lever turned off the gravity, which in turn turned on the polarizer and the flivver.\n\nFred the son and Junior the grandson were the only others who knew how to use the pircuit and the machines. There were the two women, the girl Joyce and the woman Reba. The men were Grampa Peppergrass and Fred Junior the son.\n\nThere were also two children, the son's wife's son whose name was Joyce. The daughter's husband named Junior. The two grandchildren were Junior Junior and Four.\n\n\"The Pircuit\"\n\nGrampa went into the central cabin with Fred Junior, Fred Junior's four grandchildren, Grampa Peppergrass, and a new member, a six-year-old boy who was named Four.\n\n\"I'd like to work on your grav polarization problem, Grampa,\" Four said.\n\n\"If you want to, Four,\" said Fred Junior, his voice rough. \"I can't stand around here and talk about it much longer.\"\n\n\"You can be Junior, Four,\" Junior Junior said. \"I'm Fred Junior.\"\n\n\"All right, Four,\" Grampa said.\n\n\"You can work on whatever you want, Four,\" said Junior Junior. \"Go ahead and turn on the gravity.\"\n\nFour pressed the appropriate buttons on the pircuit, and the gravity went off.\n\n\"Where?\" Reba Peppergrass asked, her voice tight.\n\nFour pointed to the central cabin and the central cabin of the flivver.\n\n\"The ship and the flivver!\" Reba said.\n\nFour was a strange child, a pale, blond child, rather like a dwarf.\n\n\"The ship does polarize the gravity,\" Grampa said. \"In effect, it does turn off gravity. The real question is why the machine, the spaceship itself, does polarize gravity into a straight line. Not why the flivver does, because that's a simple matter of molecular polarization, which any material will do. To find out, you only watch it.\n\n\"We know",

Nitworth leaned forward, looking solemn.\n\n\"They were a warlike race known in this sector back in Concordiat times, perhaps two hundred years ago. They vanished as suddenly as they had appeared. There was no record of where they went.\" He paused for effect.\n\n\"They have now reappeared\u2014occupying the inner planet of this system!\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" Second Secretary Magnan offered. \"That's uninhabited Terrestrial territory....\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mr. Magnan? It appears the Qornt do not share that opinion.\" He plucked a heavy parchment from a folder before him, harrumphed and read aloud:\n\nHer Supreme Excellency The Qorn, Regent of Qornt, Over-Lord of the Galactic Destiny, Greets the Terrestrials and, with reference to the presence in mandated territory of Terrestrial squatters, has the honor to advise that he will require the use of his outer world on the thirtieth day. Then will the Qornt come with steel and fire. Receive, Terrestrials, renewed assurances of my awareness of your existence, and let Those who dare gird for the contest.\n\n\"Frankly, I wouldn't call it conciliatory,\" Magnan said.\n\nNitworth tapped the paper with a finger.\n\n\"We have been served, gentlemen, with nothing less than an Ultimatum!\"\n\n\"Well, we'll soon straighten these fellows out\"\u2014the Military Attache began.\n\n\"There happens to be more to this piece of truculence than appears on the surface,\" the Ambassador cut in. He paused, waiting for interested frowns to settle into place.\n\n\"Note, gentlemen, that these invaders have appeared on terrestrial controlled soil\u2014and without so much as a flicker from the instruments of the Navigational Monitor Service!\"\n\nThe Military Attache pulled at his lower lip. \"That's absurd.\"\n\n\"I think it might be, eh, Retief?\"\n\nRetief turned. Zubb pushed forward.\n\n\"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\nRetief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red, reaching down to a strip of white beach with the blue sea beyond.\n\n\"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we couldn't locate the Qornt. We'll go back now and report\u2014\"\n\n\"I'm pretty sure the settlement is off to the right,\" Retief said. \"Why don't you head back for the boat, while I ease over and see what I can observe.\"\n\n\"Retief,\" Magnan whispered, his hand on Retief's arm, \"We're engaged in a serious mission. This is not a time to think of sightseeing.\"\n\n\"I'd like to take a good look at what we're giving away.\"\n\nRetief said. \"Be sure to let us know how it works out.\"\n\n\"Kindly return to your chair,\" Nitworth said coldly. \"A number of chores remain to be assigned. I think you, Magnan, need a little field experience. I want you to get over to Roolit I and take a look at these Qornt personally.\"\n\nMagnan's mouth opened and closed soundlessly.\n\n\"Not afraid of a few Qornt, are you, Magnan?\"\n\n\"Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. It's just that I'm afraid I may lose my head and do something rash if I go.\"\n\n\"Nonsense! A diplomat is immune to heroic impulses.\"\n\nRetief and Magnan topped a ridge and looked down across a slope of towering tree-shrubs and glossy violet-stemmed palms set among flamboyant blossoms of yellow and red.\n\n\"A delightful vista,\" Magnan said, mopping at his face. \"A pity we couldn't locate the Qornt.

While I was there, I was asked whether I had considered writing a novel. I demurred. I was much more interested in teaching and in doing what I did best among the people I met\u2014taking photographs of our small cast of characters as they fished, hunted, or traveled the icy world around Fairbanks.\n\nAfter returning home, I realized that I had already learned a lot about the people and places that are a central part of this book. I have spent a good bit of my life living and working among native Alaskans. In 1995, I had started work as environmental protection director for the North Slope Borough. A few months later, after being on the job for several months, I was named the deputy borough manager, and I have been working for our government for twenty years.\n\nMy late partner, Dennis Horgan, was a crucial adviser in my efforts to help the people who worked for and on the North Slope be involved in decisions about their own resources. Dennis had extensive experience working as environmental programs manager in the North Slope borough. He helped me understand their struggles and triumphs, their problems and rewards. He was an excellent man and a great partner. He has been gone for eight years now, but he is sorely missed.\n\nIn 2012, I was asked to be a visiting professor in the English department at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.\n\nOn this visit, the editor of the book of photographs that I had made of rural Alaska, Denali National Park, and my life story in the North Slope Borough came up and asked whether I had considered writing a novel. That visit was also when I began writing WITCHES. A year later, after a lot of thinking and writing, this book was published in the bookstore I frequent, The Raven, in Alaska's smallest town, Prudhoe Bay, just outside of Prudhoe Bay.\n\nI would like to thank my teachers and friends at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh, SUNY P, for all their support and encouragement while I was in school. I would especially like to thank the late Mary Jo Shuck who spent a lot of time encouraging my writing while I was at SUNY P. I appreciate all of her efforts on my behalf.\n\nFinally, for those who enjoy reading this first volume of my WITCHES OF THE FRIDAY MOOSE series, I would like to thank my readers for enjoying the story of my life, of the people I grew up with, and the places I have loved.\n\n\u2014A.

    "38": "\nThe Qornt threaten to attack if the Terrestrials do not vacate the inner world of this solar system in thirty days. Retief, a young Terran diplomat, agrees that the people of the inhabited world should be removed promptly. On the outer planet of the system, Retief and Magnan learn that Qornt aggression is more than a bluff. The Qornt have a fleet hidden behind a screen of invisibility, and their Regent is not averse to using them. Although they know that a large military force would be needed to halt the Qornt, Retief and Magnan decide that an armed diplomatic mission of one sort or another would be impossible, and instead they make a bargain with the Qornt at the last minute before the fleet is lifted.\n\nQuestions from other issues:\nIn the following story, there's a question involving an entire magazine.\n\nStory:\nGREEN SLIME AND NEXT OF KIN The Invasion of Jocelyn Station\n\nBY RAY GUNN\n\nThe magazine in question is Worlds of If Science Fiction, Nov. 1966, cover above, and the story begins:\n\nThe first I heard of the invasion was a dream that left me shaking and in the clutches of a horrible sensation of fear, as though I were seeing into the future to see a thing far more horrible than I could bear to think about. It was a vision of a world swarming, not with green plants or with white snow or with brown grain or black water, but with green slimy slime. It was the first of many weird dreams. But there was also the strange way my father looked at me and spoke, the way he talked about a secret weapon that could destroy the Jocelyn Station. And then, after I had told him it was a crazy idea and wouldn't work, I heard a roar and the sound of an explosion came clearly through the walls.\n\n...\n\nAt first it seemed as though nobody believed in the invasion except my father and me. There wasn't any reason why, for the first hundred or so ships of a huge fleet of Jovian war machines had come out just the way they had predicted they would\u2014by making orbits exactly thirty-six hours or even one-twenty-eighth of a second longer around their own sun than around the sun of their prey. Then, as they went around the orbit of Jocelyn Station at ever-increasing speed, the Jovians' orbits had lengthened until they had approached a point of closest approach to the little Martian colony world only forty hours away, when their velocities and their mutual attraction were greatest.\n\nSuddenly, as though a button had been pushed, the huge ships lifted off from Jocelyn Station, went out and away into space, while the tiny ships which had orbited the moon of Mars began to speed toward the sun-world, their orbit shortened.\n\nThat had been the only way. It was incredible that Jovian ships could lift off from a distance of only some seventy-eight million miles, and then go the whole distance over to the solar system of the little red-cheeked Martian. Yet that is what occurred. I can tell you now that the Jovian ships are powered by gigantic batteries of a hundred-seventy-two-ton atomic bomb that can be set off anywhere in a solar system\u2014and so can be used as the motive power for the entire ship, including the drive. And the little Martian ships were like great rockets: their nuclear bombs were small, but their motors could accelerate even light matter to incredible velocities.\n\n...\n\nBut then strange things began to happen\u2014things such as all-night parties in the great halls of the Jovian ships and little Martian ships making landings on the surface of Jocelyn Station. Why would Jovians attack Jocelyn Station? Surely it was an accident that had happened. We had never been told that the Martians knew the exact location of the Jovian planet or its orbit\u2014or indeed any of the Martians' secrets. It was only the previous year that had the little red people begun to make nuclear bombs of their own, but they were still no threat to us. And why should they come here?\n\n...\n\nAnd then there was the queer feeling I had. I seemed to be afraid to go about my business\u2014afraid to leave my bed. I would lie there, and dream strange dreams\u2014and then I would get up, and I would take up my guitar, and I would practice the guitar, and I would look at the picture of my mother, and once I had been thinking of a love affair I might have with one of the great blond women from Venus.\n\nI could hardly wait for the J",
    "39": "There are four interrelated storylines. The first is in the Qornt mind. The second revolves around the Terrestrials, and the third concerns relations between Earth and the Qornt. Finally, the fourth concerns the military aspect of the story.\n\n First: An ambassador of the Terrestrials goes to an alien inhabited planet to demand that they leave a world they have invaded and stolen. The Qornt don't make any effort to get rid of them, but threaten to get rid of them if the aliens do not leave first.\n\nSecond: The ambassador of the Terrestrials, who is one of the top diplomats of Earth, fails to convince the Qornt of the seriousness of the situation, and the Qornt ignore the diplomats trying to get the aliens to leave.\n\nThird: There is a subplot about the love relationship of the two leading characters. While both of them are in the thick of danger and crisis, they are also developing a bond as they work together.\n\nFourth: Earth and the Qornt (or the two governments that represent them) are rivals for a source of mineral (or radioactive dust) that can potentially be used to create vast power stations. Because it appears that the Earthly government intends to get first priority, since it has already spent a lot acquiring the knowledge that the ore exists, the Qornt decide to attack before any deal can be made\u2014a development that will surely lead to war.\n\nThe plot is in those parts marked by asterisks. Also, remember that the story makes most of its major points in the first part, beginning with the arrival of Ambassador Nitworth at the planet: \"Ambassador Nitworth glowered across his mirror-polished, nine-foot platinum desk at his assembled staff.\" The actual story takes place in the first part, with its threat of violence, the ultimatum, the military preparations (the \"crash project\"), and the rescue of the diplomats at the last. The climax of the story is in the last part, where the ambassador is attacked by the very real, if misguided, Qornt military and has to make his way home under enemy fire.\n\nQuestion: What motivates the Qornt to act in this way?\n\nAnswer: The Qornt, as Retief comments, \"are Qornt\"\u2014in other words, they must always have an opportunity to be heroes, or at least to be engaged in some sort of conflict. This is in keeping with much of what they have heard about the Terrestrials, and with their own history up to this point. The Qornt, not to put too fine a point on it, are an acquisitive, warlike race\u2014this is what gives them glory and prestige, what makes it worth their while to be Qornt.\n\nQuestion: What motivates the Terrestrials to act in this way?\n\nAnswer: The same things motivate the Qornt. They want \"expediency,\" \"survival,\" and glory. But the Terrestrials also have the \"insatiate impulse to conquer in every respect,\" as Retief puts it, and they are in a very awkward position because of their vast size, their lack of natural warlike skills, and their need to protect human lives from the horrors of war. The Terrestrials are in a hopeless situation. The only way to deal with such a foe is to destroy it\u2014or force it to destroy itself.\n\nQuestion: Why does the Ambassador and his diplomatic party come to an empty world?\n\nAnswer: This is part of the deal that he has made with his own superiors, and with the Qornt government. He is supposed to observe the planets in this system: it is their job as diplomats. But this planet (at least at this time) offers no interest to the Terrestrials, since it is virtually uninhabited; it is inhabited primarily by the Qornt and a few alien plant-people.\n\nQuestion: Why does he go on the planet at all?\n\nAnswer: That's an easier question. The answer lies in the fact that the world happens to have an active and powerful superdrive engine that the Qornt would like to have (for the same reasons that they, with their more limited drives, would like to have the mineral ore). But the Qornt also have one small but fatal flaw: they don't have a fleet of their own\u2014they have to call on other, more powerful species to send their ships on the dangerous trips. (The \"crash project\" is to give each Qornt a ship of his own to help carry them out on their raids.)\n\nQuestion: Why do the Terrestrials go to an alien planet?\n\n",

Dennis Brooke suspects him of the Martian's having a weapon or explosives on his person.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat happens on Terra when Dennis and Marla do not see each other for three weeks?\n\nAnswer:\nMarla's passion fades a little. As Dennis realizes he needs to get back on his feet emotionally, he decides to go to Venus. As a result, he and Marla begin to lead what he calls a normal interplanetary life. They live together, but they can never quite make a perfect connection, and their love goes into a slow decline.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat does Dennis expect to happen to Marla when she decides to accept an assignment?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDennis expects his assignment as a courier, and as such, he wants her at his side. But when she declines, he doesn't take it personally, and he is sure she'll be in good hands with the I.SP organization.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow does Dennis feel when a member of Koerber's crew attacks him?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDennis is furious. He is certain that Koerber has something to do with the attack, and he feels that if he could capture him, he would redeem himself in the eyes of the I.SP.\n\nQuestion:\n\nDescribe how Dennis feels when he thinks Marla will forget about him (while she was taking her assignment from I.SP)?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDennis expects to hear news at least a few times a week, but instead, he finds out about three days after that she has a husband.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhen does Dennis first feel alive in his new space suit?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAfter he becomes very excited during a battle. He is also pleased that he is not afraid. His space suit enhances his power. He is also happy that he is being given a chance to prove himself.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is George Randall's biggest problem at the beginning of the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nRandall is afraid of leaving Venus.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWho is George Randall's wife?\n\nAnswer:\n\nGeorge is engaged to a young woman named Marla.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat happens when Dennis finds out that Koerber has his cruiser magnetized?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDennis realizes that this means that he is doomed. He also realizes that he has the chance to redeem himself.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat must be done to save Dennis from Koerber's ship?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDennis must cut the jets from the ship, in order to save it. He can also use a magnetic repulsion plate to help him.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy does Dennis feel like the worst human being on Earth when they have finally located the planet with the radioactive elements?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDennis is frustrated because he lost his bride and because he had wanted to show her planets besides Venus. He also feels betrayed by I.S.P. and by Commander and Chief who could have allowed him to go after Koerber before he lost Marla.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat can Dennis expect from the I.S.P. to happen on Venus?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDennis can expect to be in jail or to be grounded forever. He expects to be either arrested or suspended from the I.SP.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat reason does Dennis have to be proud of when they crash landed on the planet with the radioactive elements?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDennis feels proud because Captain Brooke ordered him to cut the jets. He is also proud to have shown Koerber that he was the best I.SP. Captain.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat do you think about the way the story ends?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe last pages of the story can be read either as the last hope for Dennis Brooke or to say the last goodbye to something. The story is a mystery story that has a great number of unsolved questions.\n\nWhat does the reader learn about Dennis Brooke by the end of the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe reader learns that Dennis Brooke may be overconfident about his ability to become a captain again, but he also learns that he still has to prove himself, and that it does not matter what happens, if he can just redeem himself.\nWhat does the reader learn about Captain Brooke by the end of the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe reader learns that Captain Brooke is an old hand at the I.S.P. He is also realistic about life. He knows how to cope with hardships",

But his luck had run its course, and now he was marooned on a rogue planet\u2014fighting to save himself from a menace weapons could not kill. He wanted solitude, somewhere to coordinate his thoughts in silence and salvage something out of the wreck of his heart, not to speak of his career. But Venus in the throes of a gigantic boom upon the discovery of radio-active fields, could offer only one solitude\u2014the fatal one of her swamps and virgin forests.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat does Verbena mean?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDennis Brooke is served his drink Verbena (a tropical liqueur made from South American Verbena leaves); but, the vermouth is already poisoned by the Martian who wishes to kill Dennis.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat does Martian and Mercurian mean?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn Earth-English, Martian means of or from Mars and Mercurian means of or from Mercury; and in Space-English Martian means of or from Mars, while Mercurian means of or from Mercury; and in Space-English, Martian means of or from Mars, while Mercurian means of or from Mercury.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the most dangerous place to be marooned on the world?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt is the swamps where the Soul Eaters roam.\n\nBook II\n\nTHE BLACK SQUID\n\nThe crew of the I.S.P. Cruiser stood in the control room, for the most part in silence. There was a faint, tinny, humming as if of insects in a cage in the corner, as of someone running a finger over a fret-wire with a pearly-white nail. But the great stillness was the greater danger. The stillness and the silence. It was the silence that hung upon them like the ghost of a dying spirit. The gravity of the planetoid seemed to have permeated every fiber of their being. They could not seem to move. To their very souls. Nothing stirred. Not a breath of air, not a ripple on the smooth pebbled soil of the valley walled in by the ship. The entire valley was as still as an empty tomb. Silent with the stifling heat that emanated from the dying core of the planetoid.\n\nCaptain Dennis Brooke was leaning against the control console, a small, lean figure with a long lean face which was now dark with a heavy black stubble. His brilliant hazel eyes looked like the twin points of a javelin, as they fixed upon Dallas Bernan who sat hunched in the opposite corner, his immense torso as massive as a boulder in space suits, the muscles working with slow, deliberate precision in his huge, powerful arms. The Captain watched Dallas, as he began to carve his initials in the thick metal wall of the ship. Then, as if drawn by some magnetic force that was beyond human strength, his eyes went to the young man's big, round eyes. They were now filled with a deep pity. As if to a drowning man he leaned forward just far enough to strike Dallas lightly on the shoulder, the hard-muscled arm in the sleeveless arm bandage the color of polished granite. Then he moved back to the console.\n\n\"You've got nothing to prove to me, Randall.\" He spoke with quiet authority, his face impassive though his heart was beating with a furious beat under the close-fitting uniform of the I.S.P. The words were almost an automatic response but the voice was quiet and deep, with hints of the soft, rounded tones of his native England. \"Randall's no coward and you know it! But you can see how hard he has it.\" To them it was the first hint of hope that they might ever break that dreadful silence.\n\nCaptain Brooke looked down at his long hands, then back at the ship's wall on which Dallas had completed his mark. He made a small, deft gesture to Dallas to show him that the carving was fine. Then he leaned forward and struck two more marks in the metal. The carpenters would have done better work, but to this man who had spent his entire life in space, nothing was more natural than to mark his first landing on a planetoid on a sheet of metal.\n\nAs the Captain turned to the intercom, an iridescent vibration, faint and subtle, reached him from the far end of the deserted valley through which the ship walled, and a dull throbbing began to form in them. They heard faint,",

His father had taught him years ago about the coming of an upset.\n\n\"Listen to your innards. Their telltale rhythms never lie.\"\n\n\"But Daddy, sometimes they lie,\" his mother had protested. She'd been a little thing back then, and he remembered being so much older than she that he could no longer look into that beautiful, worried face. Her blue eyes were still there, though, and her voice, when she spoke to him now. \"It happens to everyone, Eugene. Your father used to pretend to feel sick every night for a year, to give you one last time to tuck into bed with books.\"\n\nThe sensation in his stomach was all the convincing he needed. He tried to convince himself that he could make it to the house without puking up every mouthful of food he'd eaten lately.\n\nBut this wasn't a matter of mere food. He wasn't even sure there was any food left inside him. Just the kind of food you eat before a fight: sandwiches filled with thick red meat and sliced white bread, potato chips and popcorn with the smell of butter and salt still lingering. He'd eaten it all, cramming himself with a kind of hunger that would be just coming to the boil, had he been on the other side of the mountain.\n\nHe made it to the corner of the road. He thought his gut would give way and send everything flying before he could reach the cover of the woods.

Whoever was out there might be in the bushes, hiding, but he didn't see anything. There hadn't been a sound. Maybe it hadn't been there at all.\n\nAnd he didn't want to see it now before he took care of business. He turned and stumbled through the woods to the house, still feeling the sensation of movement inside him, like one of those black-and-white movies where the main character is getting closer to the end of the story he thought he understood.\n\n* * *\n\nEUGENE'S FATHER'S CUSTOMIZED-OUTSIDERSIDE SAFARI Jeep Wrangler was still parked behind the garage, but the house was dark and silent as far as he could tell.

Sometimes it took hours for him to come home, and it would be just his father, sitting at the table in his undershirt, staring gloomily out the window at the street. \"This here's the end of the world. One more time, and I'm gone.\"\n\nOther times it would be his mother there, slumped in her favorite chair by the lamp, and his father on one of his good days, going around the house checking all the doors and windows and calling out to his son, \"Did you get home all right?\"\n\nSometimes it had been his grandfather, who'd lived with them for longer than anyone could remember.

It isn't too hard to come away from Mars with all sorts of \"sad stories\" of what happens to spacers there on their first missions. We can speculate that perhaps Dennis Brooke had something to hide, or perhaps there really was something unusual about Marla that he had found out about.

She tried blinking, but there was nothing there, not even black shadows.

Her stomach growled, demanding food she knew wasn't there.\n\nNo. It can't be dark, she must be hallucinating.\n\nPanic filled her veins. She tried to scream, but a heavy weight clamped her throat.\n\nShe was being eaten alive.\n\nShe knew this nightmare. This nightmare was eating her, and soon it would consume her consciousness as well, and she'd go mad and never know that she was going insane, that she was going to wake up the way she'd always hoped.\n\nShe screamed in the dark.

    "44": "\nWhen the story opens, Edmund Rice is on his way to ask Linda to marry him. He'd spent weeks and weeks rehearsing the most effective way to ask, and he was ready when the elevator didn't come. And what happens to him? The elevator is broken. Then he finds out that the elevator is not broken; there's a spy in it.\n\nWho is Edmund Rice? I think Edmund Rice was a spy. At first he says he wanted to marry Linda, but what did he really want to do? He never actually says he wants to marry Linda... he says he's waiting for her to marry him (a much different thing). So why should he be surprised that someone's found the spy? No one would have expected to propose to \"spy on the military.\"\n\nThe story's about what happens to a spy. The story wasn't about the spy... it was about the spy's effect on the people who were around him. It was about the effect of the spy on Edmund Rice's plans to propose to Linda.\n\nThe story wasn't about a spy; it was about a spy spying... it was about a spy spying on the military.\n\nTHE SPY IN THE ELEVATOR\n\nDon't say the spy's the hero, because the spy's the enemy! In fact the only real spy in the story is the spy that Edmund Rice finds. He becomes the main character, and he's the person you care about. His life's on the line, until the end of the story.\n\nThat the story doesn't focus on the spy is because the spy isn't the villain. You don't care whether a spy succeeds. You don't wish him well. In fact, you probably want him to fail. And finally, I think you're supposed to feel sorry for the spy. It's not that you wish him well. You don't even want him to succeed. But you definitely don't wish him harm.\n\nIn this story of Donald E. Westlake, he makes a comment through the character of Edmund Rice that the Projects were built in the first place so that populations wouldn't become so dangerous that everyone would be in danger... and that the Projects weren't needed in the first place because the outside world was still dangerous... and it seems as though the Projects would become obsolete. I see in the story that it takes a moment for people to realize the danger that the outside world has become. It wasn't a question of people being oblivious to the dangers of the world outside the Project; it was a matter of people being unaware of the danger that their Project has become.\nI think it can be summed up that the Projects aren't needed because the Project has become obsolete.\n\nI hope this helps\n\nMarijaB\n\nDon't tell me you can't tell what the story was about in a paragraph\u2014it can go by two pages as I've pointed out... but let's see what you've written.\n\nI think the question to ask is: why do you want to know so desperately? Is it because you don't like short stories?\n\nIs it because you don't like that the story didn't focus on the one thing you were looking for, or is it because you don't like the way that the story focused on the other thing?\n\nDo you like detective stories?\n\nOr do you want to try a collection of short stories... and if so, from what author?\nRiverboat\n\nI don't care what you wrote. You do know I'm looking for advice, yes? If I wanted you to write a story and give it to me, I would have asked you to write a story.\n\nIt's not about the spy at all\u2014the spy was there to serve as an excuse for Edmund Rice to go ask to marry Linda. It's about what happens to Edmund Rice when he has to go ask to marry Linda...\nDo you realize that the story you're thinking about is just three pages long?\n\nIf you don't like the shortness of it, why don't you try another of Donald Westlake's pieces (by him, I mean)... or maybe even Raymond Chandler's story \"Red Wind\"... or is it Dorothy L.? Ammies?\n\nWhoops\u2014that third one was supposed to be Jules Verne, wasn't it? Verne was an author... I'm thinking of Dorothy L. Sayers... or are they the same person?\n\nOr even Stephen King's \"Crawly Space\"... or are they the same person?\n\nMaybe you just want to read more stories. But you're not going to find the stories you want in a paragraph.\n\nMaybe just this one would not be a good story to start with, because you've started it, but you're not going to",
    "45": "Edmund Rice is the man who is telling this story. (As you read on you will see that he is known as The Spy In The Elevator.)\n\nI began to appreciate very quickly how hard it would be to deal with a lunatic and I had no idea what to do about him. I could think of no way to get him to stop. And the moment he did stop\u2014just as he had said\u2014or became quiet again, or, God forbid, seemed peaceful and normal, I would be exposed and vulnerable. I resolved to do nothing at all. Let him talk himself out. The thing I feared most, for my own sake, was violence. That man was a danger to be taken up patiently and dealt with at my leisure. By remaining quiet and by waiting, I thought I could give myself better time to anticipate events than I might otherwise have had. I might not be able to anticipate them, but I certainly could take precautions against them.\n\nThat's what I thought. I was wrong.\n\nWell, I thought I was, at least, but luck had nothing to do with it.\n\nEdmund Rice was the man who was telling this story. (As you read on you will see that he is known as The Spy In The Elevator.) He will meet The Woman Who Wasn't There and The Man At The Door a good while before he meets the woman who is to be his girlfriend but is actually not his girlfriend any more by the time this story is finished. Before then he will attempt The Proposal, and The Decision in the Elevator, in between running for his life, trying to catch the spy, and, once caught, trying to find him again.\n\nBut you can't guess at what this story is going to be about until you've read on a bit deeper.\n\nYou see, most of the people in this story aren't who they think themselves to be. As the story progresses, Edmund Rice realizes this. And with that realization he starts to get sick.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat kind of sickness does Edmund Rice start to get as this story proceeds?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt begins as a terrible headache and then the pain in his arm gets worse then he realizes that he is dying.\n\nAnd he won't even be able to do that.\n\nBut The Woman Who Wasn't There might.\n\nThe story gets even stranger, but not too strange.\n\nThen it gets so strange that it starts to hurt more than the pain in your head. Edmund Rice will end up in a place called The Locker Room, and then you'll feel that he has told you the whole story but The Woman Who Wasn't There won't.\n\nIt's a strange story anyway and you will have to read it to find out what does happen to Edmund Rice.\n\nI think it's strange.\n\nSo will you read it, because what you hear next is the part of the story where Edmund Rice first begins to get better.\n\nBut then the story has the effect on some people that it has on Edmund Rice, and they get worse,\n\nas bad as the guy he's caught the spy just before, and The Woman Who Wasn't There. It means the end of the world, as they think of it, or so they will think.\n\nBut if they listen to The Man At The Door then they'll get better.\n\nSome will listen, but it's not as simple as that, and some will listen but still end up having to know what does become of Edmund Rice, as bad as the guy who has just caught the spy and has himself become a spy.\n\nAnd Edmund Rice doesn't know what will become of him, either. But as he talks, which is what you have just been reading, which is all there is really to tell about it, then he finds out. He doesn't seem to know it at the time, but he finds out, as the story itself moves on. He's a man who is so sick that he is nearly crippled, and The Man At The Door will only give him back his life. But you will see that things aren't over yet for this story.\n\nAnd there's more, and it seems strange to think of that, it seems to come on all of a sudden,\n\nand a guy who is so sick that he is nearly crippled starts to get well,\n\nlike The Man At The Door, he can hardly see what's happened, he gets better, much better,\n\nand more comes on, and what comes on is strange.\n\nIt's not like any of this seems natural on the face of it, for a while it seems not to be anything he would imagine and then it starts to seem more reasonable than the way",

    "48": "\nMaitland feels that the most beautiful things in the universe\u2014space ships, the Moon, Saturn\u2014are reserved for the use of the future, and that there has been a loss of spirit in his race caused by the failure of the human race to go out into space.\nIf I can't make it out there...there's no place in this universe for me.\n\nIf there was one thing that the Earth was certain of, it was that it was the center of the universe. In a sense, this was true. No other region of space had yet been explored\u2014the stars being more than sufficient distance away to show any deficiency of interest in it. But even here, the human race was getting its first sight of things that had once been regarded as almost miraculous.\n\nAs I stood out on the lawn looking up under the immense sweep of stars, I could almost convince myself that nothing in the heavens was of greater intrinsic worth than the Earth herself. And I realized that the Earth was a sacred thing, a place for worship\u2014if no one else had discovered it already, then it was at least the last secret treasure of the universe, the last place in space where miracles could be found.\n\nWhat I had was no better than a wild hunch, like a man that sees an omen in the moon. And I knew there was a good chance that I'd be dead before my hunch bore fruit. The problem was a gigantic one; I was still a beginner\u2014\n\nOne of the most attractive things about Maitland's attitude was its sheer irresponsibility. His interest wasn't in the exploration of space per se, but in discovering the conditions that should make man eligible to go to the planets.\nThe real meaning of the story was that we are not responsible for what we do\u2014we are not responsible for what has gone before\u2014and all that we can do is to do our best in living as we find it.\n\n[Back to top]\n\n6.

    "49": "\nSpace is a major element in the story. It is the main setting, and in many ways the scene is \"spatial.\" As a result of its position as such, space is the natural focus of many of the important elements of the tale, which develop as a result of what happens to or within space. Space is the means of communication and escape. It is the scene of the action. The author takes the reader on a tour of space, the various elements of space itself, and the conditions of space. The setting is described in detail, and many of the events related to space take place within this setting.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the main character learn about space?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBob Maitland begins to learn things about space as he learns about himself. His mental and emotional reactions to space affect him as a result of what he sees in the sky. His curiosity about the Moon, Mars and the planets themselves, along with his desire to visit them, provide an important background, and the space is a setting in which the theme of space is given meaning. Space inspires both wonder and awe, and awe is given the force of a character.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the conflict in the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nMaitland faces conflict in several different ways.\n\nFirst, he has an ambition to go to Mars and the other planets. This dream is made to seem plausible by the fact that there is a group of scientists dedicated to the search for space settlements. Later, once he realizes that he is being held prisoner (and possibly against his will), he is faced with a choice between cooperating or confronting one of the story's key figures. The choice affects his future.\n\nAnother conflict is created by an inner conflict between Maitland's personal interest and that of space on a galactic level. Maitland is unaware of the presence of a vast galactic race, and this ignorance leads him to ask about such matters as interstellar travel and the population of the spacefaring race. The lack of information about the space race becomes a point of conflict between the reader (Maitland) and the space-dwelling race.\n\nThe last conflict is caused by his attempts to understand why these people feel that their interest in galactic exploration have ceased, and why Maitland himself does not feel that way. This conflict is the most important. It touches on the nature of Maitland's own humanity, and his attempts to understand the question provide a major force behind the action of the piece.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the characters like?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe characters in Space Ambition vary considerably. Several are scientists involved in the search for an interplanetary expedition, and other individuals are members of an unnamed \"galactic race.\"\n\nThe reader comes to know this group of characters as they are introduced to them through the description of their appearance and the things they say, and their reactions to space are influenced by the facts about their pasts. Several of these characters are described as having some relation to Maitland. All the members of the group are given more or less significant aspects of their personalities. As the characters get together to begin working toward finding a means of interstellar travel, the reader is introduced to the characters in the order that they are presented by the author; therefore, the reader has several pieces of information about the characters before the reader learns about the character they are presented with by the author. The various characters seem to be a mix of many people from several planets (including several people from Maitland's own time).\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the themes of the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nSpace and space exploration are the main themes. Other themes include freedom of movement, the role of technology, and the role of the individual in the larger society. There is an undercurrent of tension in many of the scenes and events, and a recurring theme is that of the \"fight to live.\"\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are the ideas and the author's attitudes reflected in the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWhile the general theme of the story is the exploration of space, this is the story's major, underlying theme. The reader is given many pieces of background information on the general theme of space before the author makes the \"discovery\" that the space aliens are also looking for humans. Then, when the aliens return, the reader has reason to believe that humans are not the only ones with an interest in space. Another theme of the story is the \"search for the individual.\" Maitland himself is looking for someone to share his own interest in interstellar travel, and he is unable to find a woman who agrees with him.

It is a world lacking only one element: transportation to the other worlds, and the man who knows the secret of that element is Maitland. Since he knows no man wants to know what other worlds are like, he can hold back information from his captor and so maintain his freedom. When he gets back to America, he finds the political and social institutions of the 20th Century are all based on an unchanging set of values, values which are antithetical to Maitland's. In America, a machine-age world, machines are considered not only useful but absolutely necessary; the 20th Century is a world in which the most important things are new scientific discoveries and the exploration of the Universe.\n\nQ:\nWhy do the characters use a lot of technical jargon?\n\nA:\n\nThe story is an example of space opera, the name for science fiction stories of the space and future type which were dominant in the 1940s and 1950s. Therefore, the main characters are all scientists and engineers; most of the setting is in laboratories, and most of the action consists of experiments, tests, and calculations. One of Bade's themes is the conflict between a 20th Century way of viewing the Universe and a man of another generation: Maitland is more concerned with the conquest of the worlds than with the conquest of human nature.\nQ:\nWhy does the author tell the story in the first person?\n\nA:\n\nBade tells the story in the first person so that the story can be identified as science fiction. By using the first person, the author tells readers that the action is imaginary; he tells them, \"This is science fiction,\" so that the readers will be reminded to suspend disbelief, to forget about the everyday problems of everyday life.\n\nQ:\nHow does Bade manage the action of a long space journey so that the reader never doubts the physical reality of the characters?\n\nA:\n\nAfter a while, the reader begins to become aware that the story really is about space exploration: the spaceship, and the use of space suits, weightlessness, the rocket burn\u2014all of it. All characters know that, in every sense, they're off the planet; they no longer talk about space travel, and they talk a lot less about physics. After a while, it almost seems to the reader that the story is set here on Earth.\n\nQ:\nWhat does the author make of an apparently simple story?\n\nA:\n\nThe story seems like simple adventure. There's a man, a scientist, and they go on a sort of safari in the desert looking for a monster. The monster actually is a machine; however, the story also deals with the struggle of Western man with his own culture: the Americans of the 20th Century are much more concerned with machines than with the advancement of humanity. If machines are important, man is less important. Maitland is more concerned with machines than with the great adventure of space.\n\nQ:\nWhy are the characters not more disturbed at the prospect of being tortured by an evil Nazi?\n\nA:\n\nSwarts acts as if a good and reasonable explanation for everything is the best way to handle Maitland. He is able to make Maitland forget about his worries; he tells him, \"Don't worry about military secrets,\" and when he finally lets Maitland in on the fact that he's being held prisoner in a different country, he advises him to forget about that, too.\n\nQ:\n\nWhy does the author use an unnamed man as a viewpoint character of the story?\n\nA:\n\nThe story is a romance, but it's a romance based on a psychological theme: why don't men still want to explore the Universe? The story uses an unnamed man as a viewpoint character because that man is the main character in the story; he is most interested in the answer to that question. He wants to find out what happened to the spirit of adventure. The unnamed man's motives for looking for Maitland\u2014the love of adventure, I think\u2014appears to have been lost in the centuries between the two times; however, in all the centuries afterward, one man could not have forgotten the spirit of adventure so completely. That man may still have the will, but the adventure no longer exists, so he's not going to find the man he seeks.\n\n## TANGERINE\n## Tangerine\n\n## RUSSELL MARTIN\n\nThis story is dedicated to Paul Haines.

    "51": "\nIn the story \"Ambition,\" Maitland, an engineer, is kidnapped in the middle of the night and brought to an unknown region of Africa. He cannot figure out what is going on, but his captors do: they are studying him as a test subject for their experiments. They believe that Maitland's greatest ambition in life is to go to Mars, and they wish to get his thoughts on that subject. At first, Maitland does not seem interested in space travel, but as the story continues, his love for the stars seems to rise up inside him. He looks forward intently to someday flying to Mars.\n\nHowever, the engineer is locked in a room with no view of the stars, and his captors are reluctant to tell him about Mars or Venus or Saturn. Finally, his captors admit that a few of the earliest humans went to the Moon and to Venus and back again. But since then it has been years since a trip to the moon or Venus has been attempted. When Maitland asks why this is the case, the girl says the answer is the world population.\n\nThis is an apt answer, because it shows the readers that space is still an important and exciting subject.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWho controls the future?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn the story \"Ambition,\" Maitland spends the night on the run in the hope that he may escape, free, and get back to his work at the atomic rocket motor labs. Though he has been shot in the shoulder and is exhausted during his ordeal, he is afraid that his capturers might be after much more than his secrets. He thinks they may be trying to control his future on Earth.\n\nTo control one's future is to control one's present, and that is just what the story's captors seem to hope to do.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is time travel?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt is time travel when Swarts, the chief captor, tells his test subject that this man's future in life is in Africa. He means that Africa is a world a thousand years in the future, and Maitland is the future. This shows that time travel is possible; it is not just something to dream about.\n\n### \"A Question of Goats\"\n### Isaac Asimov\n\n### The first contact with an interstellar ship\n\nTo my mind, one of the hardest things to write in a story is an apparently normal and everyday conversation. So this story is a bit of an experiment to see if I can do that without resorting to the usual (at least what I consider to be usual) approach.\n\n\u2014Isaac Asimov\n\nI\n\n\"That's the third week in a row, Jim. You can't expect me to just sit here day after day, waiting for them to shoot me.\"\n\nThe man shrugged indifferently. \"You don't have to sit. The chair is comfortable enough. And in another week you'd be a millionaire. They make you wait a little while, that's all. I've been here for more than a month and they haven't shot me even once.\"\n\nThe younger man frowned. \"But you're from Oregon. Surely, even in these States, they've got a firing range, or at least a wall for target practice.\"\n\n\"Of course they do. I used to work in a paper factory there. I know all about paper, and even used to shoot pretty well.\" The older man was grinning, and his voice dropped to a whisper. \"I was the best target shooter in the whole state. Why, I've even been featured in the papers: THE KILLER FROM MISSISSIPPI.\"\n\nThe younger man, his face pale, sank back in his chair. \"I've never understood how they caught you. I mean, a man like you, what chance do you stand against a couple of police? Besides, I don't see how you can have ever made it to Oregon.\"\n\nThe older man's grin broadened. \"It isn't hard to get to Oregon if you want to. I just figured out a way to get there when there wasn't a law against it, and I had the nerve to do it. Then I figured how the Oregon people could get me out of there without any trouble. I saw a chance to get rich, and I took it. There were a lot of men in that paper plant who wanted to get out more than I did, but the boss there, a fat old woman, didn't give a damn. I tried to get her out the big way, but I had to leave before the sheriff caught up with her and put an end to me. She was having a last fling before she retired, and she wasn't going to",

The Lord, through His Son the Christ, the Messiah, has provided every man with a road map to success and glory. Just keep on the one path and all roads will lead you to the gates of Heaven.\"\n\nAaron, the caterer, the second son of the late Rabbi Solomon, was striding through the city streets, still carrying his cartload of provisions from the day's market. The sun had set hours ago, but the city of God would be as bright as day itself for the next three hours. Aaron glanced at the sun disk through the sky and knew his estimate was only slightly off. A man with a mind like that of Aaron needed no astro-tab to tell him night from day. All one had to do was to look up in the night sky, that is when one wasn't occupied in some manner or other to do something besides gaze in the sky\u2014and there it was anyway.\n\nAaron turned his handsome, well-shaped face at the sound of a familiar voice.\n\n\"Hey, Aaron,\" said the voice.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Oh, Aaron,\" and the voice broke into a laugh.\n\nAaron turned again and caught a glimpse of the one he loved, so much he wanted to think it was true. But his own eyes did not confirm it.\n\nThe girl was gone.\n\nThe voice said, \"Hey, Aaron, what is wrong? Have I come back from the dead?\" The voice was filled with disbelief, yet the girl wasn't afraid, as if in the face of it there must be proof.\n\n\"Wrong?\" Aaron repeated. \"Why, everything is right. It's very dark, I know. But everything is right. My feet have carried me from the Holy Temple to my home. I have made my daily tribute to the Priest, and my wife and children await me at the door. It is no time to ask for wrong. But then\u2014the world is a world of wrong.\"\n\n\"Aaron, where are you going? Wait, please\u2014\"\n\n\"Home,\" said Aaron, and he walked away and he did not try to explain anything, but when he looked back he saw the girl was no longer there. The moon had not yet risen.\n\nAaron pushed open his door, set his cart in the hallway, and said to the one he loved, \"Come in, my love.\"\n\nHe went to the sink of water, wet his hands and face, so that his wife would not have to touch them, and",
    "55": "The story takes place on the planet Venus. Venus is an inner planet and the story of an officer of the Inter-planetary Patrol who has been grounded on a Venusian planet. On Venus, the most beautiful woman on five planets awaits him.\n\nThe I.S.P. is on Venus. The story opens the first planet which the officer visits as a guest, in Venus's Inter-planetary Palace. In the Inter-planetary Palace, an exotic Martian Dancer dances for the Spacer. When the Spacer is about to leave Venus, the Dancer, who is much more than a Dancer but a spy for Koerber, tricks him into a fatal struggle. Koerber is a well-known space pirate, who has once been arrested by the Inter-planetary Patrol. With five planets of women and a career ruined, the spaceman is a man with nothing to lose. He is to die in the struggle when he refuses to accept the I.S.P.'s decision.\n\nThe reader learns more about Venus as he travels further from it, and eventually finds himself on a planet. A planet that has been discovered to contain a deposit of radioactive material and is rich in resources. At this planet the spaceman may find refuge in the arms of the woman he loves.\n\nWhat do we learn about Venus after the Spacer learns it is a planet that is radioactive but has incredible natural riches. He hears about Venus during his time at the Inter-planetary palace. He hears from the Inter-planetary palace servants. He sees the beauty of Venus. He learns of the lush vegetation and the luxuries of the palace and of its decadence and of its decadent society. The world, Venus, is a paradise in a way, which men from worlds far beyond the inner stars can have pleasure in. The reader learns, however, there is a great danger to the planet, the peril of an atom-blast. There is also the danger of the men who can cause atom-blasts. These men are the space pirates. Space pirates would make atom-blasts that would damage the planet's resources.\n\n\"The planet is a paradise in a way, which men from worlds far beyond the inner stars can have pleasure in.\" The reader will note, the only way for a spaceman is to be a pirate or an outlaw. The spaceman feels the necessity of becoming a pirate or outlaw to live and to obtain what pleasure he wants. The spaceman had nothing to offer. It is stated that, \"on five planets of women....\" It is stated there are women waiting for him. In Mars only a few of the interplanetary patrol officers are left. The Inter-planetary Patrol is the most elite branch of the I.S.P. and the men and women in it are the best of the best. Some are women, like Marla, whom the spaceman loved. He could only get to Mars in a desperate situation and then he could only get there for a few moments before he had to return to duty. Mars is a world that the Spacer was never free to visit before. The spaceman could only dream of Mars. As a member of the Inter-planetary Patrol he has, however, seen Mars, just after an atom-blast has wrecked it. This is what he had wished to have seen from Venus: \"the lush vegetation and the luxuries of the palace and of its decadence and of its decadent society.\"\n\nThe spaceman may have lived for a moment or two on Mars before he had been compelled to return to the five planets. In Mars he may have lived in the Inter-planetary Palace like an empress, he would have been the highest man in the place and he still could have been grounding. One can tell, the Spacer loved Mars, he still did, but one has also to remember of Venus being a paradise. Venus is a paradise because there were other planets around it. The spaceman had spent his time either in the Inter-planetary Palace or he has been sent to the planet that was just coming in sight and in that planet he had also seen the lush vegetation and the decadent opulence. At his previous posts he has been confined to that planet. The spaceman only stayed for a few moments on Mars before he had to return to the five planets where the greatest of the women of the interplanetary Patrol were on duty.\n\nIn the story, however, the Spacer is left on Venus and must make his way to Mars from there. Although he left his lover on Mars he soon thinks of marrying the woman he leaves on Venus. The man has a deep appreciation of the pleasure of his first love, Marla. He knows the beauty of Venus and also the decadence and luxuries of",
    "56": "The two Terrans stood on the edge of the clearing, where the priest-dancers had gathered about a stone dais at which a great golden bowl stood filled with water from the rain. The temple's main cavern yawned cold, dark and enormous behind the small group of priest-dancers, who were chanting in voices thin as reeds. Skkiru had once, while wandering aimlessly through the library, flipped through a fictape on the old pagan religions of ancient Earth, and he knew that the Earth priest-dancers, so he understood, were supposed to be dancing to call the rain.\n\n This is one of the first things I ever wrote, and I was never quite happy with the story. There are not enough details in it. Where is the detail?\u2014especially on this, the key page?\n\nHowever, I feel it can still be improved. Most of the story can be condensed, and some of the exposition\u2014especially the bit about the Terrestrials eating native inhabitants\u2014can be done by dialogue. I tried to avoid that kind of thing before\u2014but I think I could do it now. But it would probably mean that the reader would get most of the information directly from Skkiru's mouth\u2014and that would be too jarring on the reader.\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of the few stories of mine that might have been improved by not trying to write it. Since the idea behind it is a strong one\u2014an idea I don't think I ever discarded\u2014I will try to work it up sometime, when I have got a little more experience. But this is one story that probably isn't for me.\n\nOn to Snaddra II, The Escape, where the reader is introduced to an important character.\n\n## Snaddra II: The Escape\n\n## by EVELYN E. SMITH\n\n### One\n\nThere should have been no reason why Skkiru should even bother to go outside during the day. He wasn't a metal-worker or anything like that; he was a private citizen and, in the opinion of Larhgan\u2014the high priestess of Snaddra\u2014private citizens weren't supposed to be out and about during the day, anyway\u2014just like savages.\n\nThe problem was, though, that every time he went out, he got caught. He got caught by the rain. Skkiru was fond of food; he enjoyed his sleep and the view he got of the universe from his bed during the night, both in bed and awake\u2014for Snaddra was one of the planets which supported the night-day. That it rained all day and half the night was one of the things that had made them choose Snaddra in the first place.\n\nAfter the first time he'd gotten caught in that first rainstorm, then the first time he'd managed to escape being \"caught\" and take shelter in an air-car, he couldn't go out without rain gear. But the only rain gear available was not only extremely primitive\u2014the stuff had been designed so that a person standing still in the rain would remain almost dry\u2014but the only thing of the sort in the whole capital city was at the Temple of I-Know-Not-Who\u2014the only two copies of which were both worn out by the time Skkiru finally managed to get one. And that was the only place he could ever get any rain gear, because he was only a private citizen. High priests didn't have to walk about in the rain; they went all the time from their homes to the Temple and back, and anyway, they had air-cars.\n\nThis was just a matter of luck, Skkiru thought as he splashed through the mud toward the Temple. For instance, it happened to fall on one of the ceremonial days; it was such a pity so much of his talent had been wasted on architecture and sculpture that he could hardly do any other kind of work, but he certainly couldn't get any orders to produce anything at all unless he could get Bbulas to approve of it, but he couldn't get Bbulas to approve of anything\u2014and, anyway, it was the same for other people, too: there was nothing for anyone to do except collect food and carry it.\n\nAnd, anyway, now that all the factories were closed and the workshops deserted, the people didn't have to slave about in the heat and dust any more.\n\nWhen Skkiru first heard about the Planetary Dilettante Plan, he hadn't liked it\u2014not even as a joke, which it was. To shut down the industries that formed the very foundation of Snaddra's economy and culture\u2014not to mention its civilization\u2014and replace them with a culture of",
    "57": "\nSnaddra was a planet with three natural satellites which provided the only reliable sources of its natural resources. It lay at the edge of the habitable Galaxy and was inhabited by a species of short four-legged mammals, whose scientific name was Snaddra. They were bipedal and spoke at least half a dozen tongues\u2014one of which was an early form of Inter-galactic. Like the others they were small and rather delicate, and the females' ears were not like human ears, but were delicate flappings instead. They were also somewhat monochromatic in color, but there were shades of brown and tan as well, depending on the season. Being mostly a vegetarian species, they could be said to have had only two colors\u2014brown and tan. Their principal means of sustenance was to subsist on the proteinous rice which supplied a considerable bulk of their nutrients, and this was grown in large fields. They were not allowed to soil their hands while growing the paddyfields.\n\nThey were divided into classes, according to size and weight. They dressed like the pictures of ancient men and women on the ceiling of Skkiru's apartment.\n\nTheir principal natural resources are rice and gold\u2014which, among the Terrans, was considered a rare and precious metal. The Earthmen were willing to pay a good deal for both. However, the price of both seemed to be on the rise at this particular time.\n\nThe only terrestrial animal species of any importance is the doga\u2014which eats snakes, fish, grimpatches and each other; in return it brings a pleasing and well-balanced flavor to the savory terran casseroles. Like the humans, it is a quadruped, but it has only two limbs. In their primitive days, the Snaddrath hunted the doga for meat, but the doga's bite is extremely venomous, and so they lost their taste for it. A doga's teeth, incidentally, are black and sharp. There are no humans on Snaddra, as has often been erroneously reported.\n\nNo humanoid animal species. However, there are some intelligent animals. The most common of these are the pigeons, which are often captured and tamed by the Snaddrath for the pleasure of flying them about the compound roofs on their short, stubby wings and making them do tricks. There are three principal varieties of pigeon, all native to the planet. These are distinguished only by feathers which are a little different. They are, however, all equally intelligent.\n\nAnother common pet is the domestic cat. The domestics are slightly larger than their wild ancestors and have longer tails. As a result, they are more difficult to domesticate than the pigeons, and the Terrans had to spend considerable time and effort in the process. In return, they receive an affectionate companion of the purest white, soft fur, with the most exquisite blue eyes.\n\nAnother intelligent animal is the rat. The native rat is about three times the size of a rat of similar shape on other planets. It differs in the direction of its eyes and has a thin, delicate muzzle of pointed teeth which it uses in biting off scraps of food.\n\nThe planet has very few trees, because they were regarded on Snaddra as a natural resource which had to be conserved. However, in the lower latitudes a large proportion of terran animals on other planets were terrestriated, and so they had some trees\u2014particularly the oak. The Snaddrath of those latitudes were, therefore, not much interested in cutting them down.\n\nThe local fauna does not include many forms of birds, as the large number of insects\u2014and sometimes even other animals\u2014eaters made the birds unnecessary. The only exception to this is the parrot, but they, like all parrots, except on Thar, are very hard to cage.\n\nThere is one mammal other than the Snaddra, but this is a species which the Terrans bred for meat on Gamrell and which they exported to different planets, for the meat there was not so much esteemed as the meat from Snaddra. On a couple of the planets it served as a pet.\n\nThis species of Mammalia is called a boar. A boar's only significant appearance is its tusks, which are rather small but very sharp. The boar is a very rare animal, but the one specimen on Snaddra had been bred for it, by one of the last surviving families of Terrestrials.\n\nThe Planet is one hundred light-seconds from Gamrell. There are two ways of getting there.\n\nThe first is by space, which it takes the space ship\u2014of course\u2014six minutes to cover\u2014and Snaddra has only one planet with",
    "58": "\nThe setting was the Council Chamber. It was an unusual room, decorated like an overdecorated church\u2014even though Snaddra was not a religious planet\u2014with what is known on Earth as \"an imposing effect.\" Of course, it would have been out of place to do otherwise. The room was filled with richly colored drapes, huge, old-fashioned tapestries and a number of objects which had been gathered from various parts of the universe. Skkiru had been told they were relics and had supposed that \"relics\" must be the plural of \"relic\" and also meant ancient and interesting artifacts of the past. Still, his ignorance did not diminish the grandeur of the objects\u2014and that was enough to keep him spellbound for long uninterrupted periods. Indeed, for a long time he had scarcely thought at all before his visits to the room. Even when he was inside it, his attention was riveted by the glitter of the great polished reflector at which Bbulas, as high priest, always adjusted himself before conducting a council meeting. There was a certain pleasure in being able to gaze into it with the other Snaddrath and reflect as one unit. It was the same sensation of togetherness that the reflecter provided, but the chamber was the next best thing.\n\nDescribe a typical member of the planet's populace in relation to the story.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe members of the populace were the Snaddrath.\n\nGive some evidence that the characters and setting are typical of those times.\n\nAnswer:\n\nA. When the two Terrestrials landed, Skkiru and Bbulas flew down from the rooftop like pigeons, in a flutter of excitement. Their hats were flapping like crazy, the sky was an angry gray and the air was cold and wet. It was in the wet season. The Terrestrials were the most important people in the known universe and Snaddra was a backward, ugly little planet, crawling with a few millions of unprepossessing brown men- and women, which were about to be overrun by their culture just as they overran every other planet on which they had set foot\u2014which was one of the reasons why they were so choosy about the places they visited.\n\nWas there any one thing, a trait or situation, that defined the character of the characters and the planet?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe defining trait was that the Terrestrials had money. The story was about the Snaddrath, so that trait was an important one, but the Terrestrials were in part responsible for creating the whole dilemma the Snaddrath were in, so there was another reason it was important.\nDescribe how the setting and the typical member of the populace affect the reader's perception of the story.\n\nAnswer:\n\nA. The setting and the typical member of the populace affect the reader's perception of the story by showing that Terrestrials were always more sophisticated, wealthy and self-confident.\nWhat made you, the reader, interested in the story?\n\nAnswer:\nI was, and I was interested in the story because it showed how money could be of use for the welfare of an entire planet and of its people, rather than used greedily by a few individuals as it was in my own times.\nWhat were some of the problems that the characters and their setting had?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe problems were that the Terrestrials' arrival was going to be disastrous for the Snaddrath. They were in a hopeless situation: The planet was impoverished to the last cent and the life-forms inhabiting it were on the verge of extinction.\nWho was the protagonist of the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe protagonist was Larhgan. She was the most well-educated person on the planet, and that made her the smartest of all the Snaddrath: She knew what was best for the planet but could not change the laws.\nWhat do you feel for the characters as a consequence of the plot?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI feel for the characters as a consequence of the plot because they did what could really have been done for the betterment of the planet, even if it were not a very easy thing to do.\nDo you like the characters and do you believe in the story?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI like the characters enough and believe in the story, but then it comes out that money isn't everything, or they wouldn't have gotten such a bad reception. It shows how money is not quite as good as other things can be, but then the Earthmen are always greedy and that is bad for everyone else, too.\nHow would you classify the story?\n\n",
    "59": "A planet in a solar system in the galaxy. But although Snaddra is not of Earth origin, it resembles Earth in some ways: for instance in having four sexes (the difference being that females are dominant). There is only one form of government on Snaddra, and no other life-forms exist on the planet itself.\n\nCharacter of the Plot\n\nThe story is humorous and satirical, as is typical of much science fiction. It contrasts the Terran visitors with the Snaddrath who are trying (badly) to mimic life in a primitive environment.\n\nThe Story\n\nA young man (Skkiru) with a university education (which gives him the ability to read and write) is made a beggar so that a primitive culture the Earthmen are studying can attract tourists. He feels humiliated by this, until he begins to enjoy his position. He and his high-priestess sweetheart (Larhgan) then start a new religion for the salvation of the planet.\n\nTheme\n\nThe plot and characters of this story are typical of much SF. It shows man's futile attempts to get back to a \"pure\" environment, and the resulting tragedy.\n\nStyle\n\nThe style of this story is typical of a galaxy tale, which features an Earth-like setting. The SF style is rather dry and factual in approach, emphasizing things in black or white. There is little variation from story to story. A galaxy tale is typically a short story with a science element, not a novel or novella. The stories are usually written in a third person point of view and the style is descriptive.\n\n\n\nEuropa Editions  \n214 West 29th St.  \nNew York NY 10001  \ninfo@europaeditions.com  \nwww.europaeditions.com\n\nThis title is also available as an e-book: ISBN 978-1-61312-077-5\n\nThis publication is made possible with support from:  \nLannan Foundation; the National Endowment for the Arts; the New York State Council on the Arts; the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs; NYSCA;  \nthe Howard Gottshalk & Mara Gottshalk Family Foundation; the Lambent Foundation; the  \nCullman Center at the New York Public Library;  \nHornblower Foundation; the O'Donnell Family Foundation; the Brownstein Foundation; George  \nS. and Sally Sternberg Foundation; Susan and Peter Suntag, M.D.  \nSara and Josephine Zeldin; the Elise and Walter B.

His role is very subtle; he has not told Matheny about his connection with the Little Girl or the Red Ankh, hoping to get valuable information about the Martian Embassy without spilling it.\n\nQuestion. Have you seen the statue of the red queen yet? \n\nAnswer. You mean the one on Pluto? Or the one at the airport\u2014on Mars?\n\nQuestion. Is this another example of the Poul Anderson technique, of setting a joke without telling a reader what it is?\n\nAnswer. The Statue of Liberty, which stands on Pluto, is in fact the Venusian goddess Anita. The bronze figure at the Pluto spaceport is a full-scale model of Antiche, the main female personality of the Venusian computer network Venus.\n\nQuestion. Would a young fellow be interested in a girl with two radar?\n\nAnswer. If she carries them in her ears. Otherwise, no.\n\nQuestion. If you were on Earth, which would you like better, money or a woman?\n\nAnswer. It depends on the woman. It is hard to describe a person without telling a person's sex.\n\nQuestion. Do Poul Anderson's aliens on the other planets think like humans? Or do they think altogether differently?\n\nAnswer. Anderson's stories are often based in part on the idea that you can tell much about a character's background and even intelligence based on such apparently uninteresting characteristics as accent, body language, clothes, and so on. His aliens often look and talk like humans, though with minor features such as the lack of sweat glands, while they react to situations much as humans do.\n\n\n## Dedication\n\nFOR ALL MY TIA, ALL MY LAZ, AND ALL MY LOVE,  \nTHEN AND NOW\n\n## Contents\n\nCover\n\nTitle Page\n\nDedication\n\nContents\n\nPrologue\n\nChapter 1\n\nChapter 2\n\nChapter 3\n\nChapter 4\n\nChapter 5\n\nChapter 6\n\nChapter 7\n\nChapter 8\n\nChapter 9\n\nChapter 10\n\nChapter 11\n\nChapter 12\n\nChapter 13\n\nChapter 14\n\nChapter 15\n\nChapter 16\n\nChapter 17\n\nChapter 18\n\nChapter 19\n\nChapter 20\n\nChapter 21\n\nChapter 22\n\nChapter 23\n\nEpilogue\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBack Ads\n\nCopyright\n\nAbout the Publisher\n\nPrologue\n\nOn the first floor, on the end of the hallway, they set up our little command center. My team of six, a man and woman at each position. The place reeked of smoke, stale air and fear.\n\nBut I'd lived in too many buildings like that to be terrified. In my mind, I called to the men and women who sat before their screens, beckoning back. Call them here. I want to know what the hell is going on.\n\nThe lights were dim and low, and all of us sat in silence. Just listening to the drone of air conditioners, watching the flicker of fluorescent lights. But for all of that, the place looked almost like a home computer center. A man and woman, both wearing short-sleeved shirts. Our positions and positions of the team were in our eyes. The left one on the computer; the right one with her back to the screen. She was on her phone, just as I'd instructed, just calling me like she always did. No more texts. No more secret notes or emails. For the duration. The middle people, a man and a woman, both looking at the feed. And the last man, me. In the middle. With space all around. Sitting, sitting...\n\nMy brain went blank. Like I'd stopped a minute too long to listen to the music. My thoughts were silent and they seemed to crawl out of me. My body didn't know where to go. My hands... I remembered, after like forever, that my hands were still. And then their words came back.\n\nYou okay? he asked, nodding again at the feed.\n\nYes.\n\nI didn't hear him answer at first.\n\nThey weren't just waiting for me. They'd been waiting for hours. They'd been waiting for a week. Ever since the man on the screen screamed.\n\nMy jaw went slack, and then my head was a bit numb.\n\nSomeone spoke, but their voice broke like they were far away from me.

On top of that, he was a good friend of Mr. Sastro, who is still going with Peri. After Gus has set things up for Sam Wendt to make love to Peri, Gus will have the two of them to himself. Gus wants Peri to marry him out here on Earth so he can become one of Mars' first billionaires. He'd like Peri to be his second wife.\nAUTHOR'S NOTE (BY   \nPoul and Karen  \nAnderson)\n\nMost of the items in this story are actual; or, rather, I say most. My information about the Red Ankh and the Junie O'Brien scam is secondhand, for instance. I took it from \"the authoritative voice\" of the time, Time itself. As I remember, it was a great thing in olden days; as now, people didn't like to think that someone, somewhere had actually learned something they didn't know. As far as actuality goes, I can say that \"The Church of Choice\" has been more or less accurate in everything from the bar on Mars to the slang of Devil's Kettle, and all else that seems peculiar is only a little poetic license; nothing is further or more removed from real Earth than is the whole concept of a government-run game of chance.\n\nThe Martian is a small, slender, delicate little fellow. By human standards, his physical equipment seems meager; by Martian standards, we're built up like mummies. Thus there are bound to be people on Mars who are extremely powerful; in fact, it is probably essential that there should be.\n\nThe last Martian novel that was a success from the start was probably Jules Verne's From the Earth to the Moon. The two main reasons for that was Verne's wonderful story, and the fact that Verne made his Martians seem so very alien. Verne, unfortunately, made them look like reptiles. It is possible to take reptiles and make them seem attractive, but it isn't likely to happen without great care. I had some trouble thinking of the right sort of Martian looks; it took a friend's aid.\n\nI wish that I had been there to take part in the opening of the first Martian embassy, but I'm afraid I had more sense than that; even when I lived out the coast, it didn't seem as if I would care to go a hundred miles out of my way for a glimpse at the moon.\n\nDEDICATION\n\nFor my children. I didn't get to say good luck a lot in the past few years. I am so happy that we're getting another shot.\n\n* * *\nCONTENTS\n\nDedication\n\nChapter One\n\nChapter Two\n\nChapter Three\n\nChapter Four\n\nChapter Five\n\nChapter Six\n\nChapter Seven\n\nChapter Eight\n\nChapter Nine\n\nChapter Ten\n\nChapter Eleven\n\nChapter Twelve\n\nChapter Thirteen\n\nChapter Fourteen\n\nChapter Fifteen\n\nEpilogue\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nAbout the Author\n\nBooks by Jody Hedlund\n\nBack Ads\n\nCopyright\n\nAbout the Publisher\nCHAPTER  \nONE\n\nNOVEMBER 15, 1847\n\n\"SIGNORA, I DO not know how to thank you.

There are hills and a valley or two. There are caves and little bogs. This morning on the way to the landing place of the expedition ship _Bird of Paradise_ I stood on the plain of the dunes and looked down the blue curve of time to the red and orange splendor of the setting sun. The wind carried no sound but the hum of the solar wind in the ship's engines. To the horizon on this Martian evening the desert, and beyond the desert even more desert, moved in waves across the eye, and on the horizon the dunes were red and purple. It was beautiful, beautiful. I wish it were a dream.\n\n\"But Mars is a difficult place to work. The radiation from the sun and the ionizing particles from the solar wind and other things blow over. Your skin gets burned off. The dust sticks in the eyes and mouth. They used to issue green glasses to see through the clouds of dust. When you walk off the road, you walk into the dust storm. You step into the road, you walk off.\n\n\"That is the reason for the expedition ship and the reasons for you. It is not",

Specifically, it is the story of three people, two men and a girl, who are running a con game on the corporate structure of Mars. The con is so ingenious that it fools everyone but Matheny, who is the hero of the story.\n\nGus Doran is introduced as someone who has a contact with a \"yokel Martian\" who can be \"put on\" to believe that an investment of money in something called a \"Teamsters Hour\" will result in great financial gain, with minimal risk. He is hired by the three people to recruit and train a \"con man\" for them, to handle the business end of the investment scheme and to act as liaison between the Earthman and the Martian.

The first was \"A Witch Shall Be Born\" and the second was \"The Valley of Thousand Cults,\" which was first known as \"The Black God's Daughter\" and later as \"The World of Henry Esmond.\" I thought it would be nice to put these stories together in this collection.\n\n## A Witch Shall Be Born\n\n(1946)\n\nHe stood facing the wall, as if listening. The candle-flame flickered against his skull-face, but he did not take his eyes off the door. The girl stood at the table, her hands clutching a book. Her lips moved soundlessly, and her cheeks were flushed. The dark brows arched over her pale eyes.\n\n\"Are you asleep?\"\n\nShe nodded.\n\nHe spoke in a low voice. \"There's something\u2014a thing outside. Something very hungry.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nHe whispered, his mouth close to her ear. \"The door. It's got a\u2014a very terrible thing behind it. Perhaps a thing alive, with teeth.\"\n\n\"Come\u2014go away. It's just your imagination.\" Her fingers played idly in the open book. She smiled up at him over their tops. \"I'm sleepy,\" she said. \"Can't you see? I'm sleepy. Go away.\"\n\n\"No.\" The shadows on his face made his voice hoarse. \"It's outside\u2014very close outdoors.\"\n\n\"It's the moon,\" she whispered. \"It's just the moon, silly.\"\n\nThe candle-flame winked out, and they were plunged into darkness. The wind howled outside. The floor creaked and the shadows of furniture moved, as if something prowled on the other side of the window.\n\n\"It's only a wind,\" she said after a moment. \"I'm sleepy.\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, and he bent over her and put out the candle and wrapped his cloak around her and carried her to the sofa beside the door. The girl's hand stroked idly across the top of the wall beside her and then closed across the book, and, after the boy was sleeping, her fingers crept in there and touched the knife on the shelf there.\n\nIt stood there, a hilt gleaming in light of flame, and his hand reached out and caught hers and moved the thing to a place closer, so that his hand would move it if she should scream....\n\nBut she spoke in sleep, and he answered in sleep, and after the dawn she went softly out of the door, and he came out of the house long after daylight fell.\n\nThe autumn wind was warm and friendly, but he did not return home. Nor did he know when winter came or the spring. He walked away until he was lost in darkness among the trees of a forest and slept under a log in a little dell where the air was pleasant and the wind sang in his ears. He woke one morning and heard the bells of a village, and went nearer and found a town and saw the people of the people, and went into the inn and ate bread upon a table, and rested and dressed and found a market-place that smelled and where things stood and he saw something with legs of two colors and two heads, and went upon his way until he came to the high rocks and climbed over to the top and saw the ocean of lights below.\n\nThe road wound in and out of rock and forest, and sometimes a shadow would cross it, and there would be",

For the last four weeks before his ship is due at Canalopolis, Mars, he does not pay any attention to her. They have had the same conversation about three times and she knows that eventually he will make his peace with her and send her home.\n\nBut when his ship is within 28,000,000 miles of Sol, with Gorman aboard the Lachesis, she is desperate. She insists that he should make the dash to rescue the Lachesis and Atropos using the surge-circuit. She tells him that the circuit hasn't been used in ten years and no one can predict what will happen if he makes the attempt.\n\nHe refuses and he is about to turn away and return to the control panel when he sees an Aphrodite in the distance. It is as if a ray of light has beamed down from Earth. She is like a beacon to him. He is drawn to her like a shipwrecked man to a lighthouse. All the rest of his crew have fainted from the heat and they are running very low on fuel so he takes her in. During the week that he spends in her company, something changes in him. He has always felt as if he did not belong to his crew. That he could always be replaced at any moment. Even his lover. She has always known this, and she is hurt by it. When he sends her home, it is final. The following day he is assigned to her ship and she tells him that her father designed it. She wants to try to save the Lachesis and Atropos by using the ship to suck them into space. It is what the circuit is capable of at maximum. The circuit is locked, and the last time it was used, Aphrodite blew her guns and fell apart. Old Aphrodisic blew herself apart and he wants the chance to prove that the fault was that the crew had never been trained properly to handle the ship. His old ship will take him into deep space once more and it will be the last time. He turns up the circuit and they move through space toward the Lachesis and the Atropos. But they are flying into the sun, and he is too frightened to stop the journey.\n \nPENGUIN CANADA \u2022 BUFFALO GOSS\n\n### Buffalo Gals\n\nA Vintage Short\n\nJULIANA BARR\n\nPENGUIN CANADA\n\nPublished by the Penguin Group\n\nPenguin Group (Canada), 90\n\nEglinton Avenue East, Suite 700, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4P 2Y3 (a division of Pearson Penguin Canada Inc.)\n\nPenguin Group (USA) Inc., 375 Hudson Street,\n\nNew York, New York 10014, USA\n\nPenguin Books Ltd, 80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England\n\nPenguin Ireland, 25 St Stephen's Green,\n\nDublin 2, Ireland (a division of Penguin Books Ltd)\n\nPenguin Group (Australia), 250\n\nCamberwell Road, Camberwell, Victoria 3124, Australia (a division of Pearson Australia Group Pty Ltd)\n\nPenguin Group (NZ), 67 Apollo Drive,\n\nRosedale, Auckland 0632, New Zealand (a division of Pearson New Zealand Ltd.)\n\nPenguin Books (South Africa)\n\n(Pty) Ltd, 24 Sturdee Avenue, Rosebank,\n\nJohannesburg 2196, South Africa\n\nPenguin Books Ltd, Registered Offices:   \n80 Strand, London WC2R 0RL, England\n\nFirst published in _Granta_, Volume 13, Number 5\n\nand Canadian ed.

    "65": "\nLieutenant Ivy Hendricks is Strykalski's Executive Officer, and she is the logical successor to the Ganymede, given Strike's obvious limitations. Strike has done all he can to get rid of her, but the forces that have brought him to the Aphrodite have a will of their own. Ivy is not \"good enough\" for Strike, and he is trying to send her down, \"the old tube\". The problem is that Strike does not realize how good a pilot she is, and he is afraid to try it. The result is that Ivy has no place to go on the Ganymede, and the Aphrodite is in the hands of Cob. It's an impossible situation, and only one solution is available.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat are the circumstances of young Ensign Coburn Whitley's arrival on board the Aphrodite?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt is important to note that Cob is an orphan, without connections or allies. He is young and inexperienced, and it is unlikely that he will be promoted to the status of Executive. This fact, coupled with his lack of formal education, makes him a \"loser,\" destined to remain an Ensign forever unless he somehow manages to gain an ally... like young Strykalski, or like Horatio Gorman, Cominch Inplan. Because of his \"orphan\" status, it is unlikely that Gorman can move openly against him. However, because Cob's name appears on a draft card listing himself as a \"colonist,\" he may be drafted for the Space Navy. Strike has no intention of letting this happen, and, when Gorman comes to the Ganymede, Cob will \"get even.\"\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the significance of the way in which young Cob is treated by the other officers (the only ones) on board the Aphrodite?\n\nAnswer:\n\nStrike has never had trouble with his superiors, and Cob has never had a superior who would even try to take notice of him. His \"Orphan\" status makes him a target for Gorman, and at some point he will be thrown a bone. It is likely that Gorman will use him to break Strike, thus ensuring Cob's loyalty. The final scene takes place after Strike and his E/O have set out for Mars, and it involves Cob's \"return\" to Venusport, where they have arranged for Gorman to have an accident... thus freeing Cob and sending him safely down the tube with his \"colonist\" friends. The action shows the way Gorman plans to use Cob... or at least it does until it all goes wrong. This section has been omitted from this version, but the book itself was, and you can find it in the library.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the opening scenes of Strike's time on the Aphrodite?\n\nAnswer:\n\nStrike and his two friends from Ganymede escape from an ill-fated mission to a colonist camp on Venus. Their plan to \"go native\" will set in motion a series of events that will culminate in a disastrous run into the mouth of the Procyon Nebula, a \"melt-down\" that ends in the deaths of everyone on board. This has been left out of this version and may be found in the book, but it will serve to suggest what Strike's life has been like.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the chapter in which Strike and Celia Graham argue about the Aphrodite's maneuverability?\n\nAnswer\n\nThe scene demonstrates Strike's basic weakness - he trusts his own judgment too much. By contrast, Celia Graham is a pragmatist, and she can foresee where Strike is likely to end up. \"Lover-Girl\" is a \"jinx\" ship, and her surge-circuit is probably no safer than Strike's personal life. Strike's decision to take a jinx ship on a vital mail run suggests that he is not as smart as he pretends to be, and it also suggests that he should be put out of commission for his own safety. Aphrodite and Strackalnski are going to die, and if the story were over here that would be the end of it. But it isn't. They've still got to do what they can to save two other ships... the Lachesis and the Atropos. Strike and his E/O will die trying.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the purpose of the last three chapters of the story concerning Strike and Ivy Hendricks and young Cob Whitley?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe story now shows where the other ships have gone, leaving Cob and their beloved Lover-Girl to their own devices... and",

SOMETIMES, WHEN she closed her eyes, Kiki thought she could make out the shape of a man in its beams, or of a child, an oversized cartoon figure in red, yellow, and green, or of a woman, a ghostly outline, holding an old-fashioned cigarette, but the man or the child or the woman weren't hers; they belonged to someone else's movie and they were floating toward her, coming to her, out of the past, and she knew that she must flee. She would try to, but she would fail, but she would not know it until too late, and the moment would be her own, and she might wish for it, so long as she didn't know that she wanted it\u2014as if she'd been waiting for it, as if she'd known all along, with an ache that sometimes seemed too profound to be pain and that seemed too deep to be knowledge, as if it were an ache as heavy as blood, and she would wonder if the ache was love.\n\nShe had called herself into this thing. She had wanted it, had wanted to go out with a flair, with a flourish. She had wanted it to end, to be a perfect end. She had wanted it. And everything had started out wrong.\n\nIt wasn't her decision to make. They didn't let her decide. They were watching, they were waiting. They knew, they'd prepared. If everything had been the way it was supposed to happen, she would have had to wait all night, all night, until it was morning, and then she would hear that it was done, that the world was done; for the world was the world, and it would happen, just as it always did, as it does every morning, because the world began at dawn every morning, that is, in the morning light.\n\nShe had started to think that she'd been wrong.

    "67": "\nIvy Hendricks is a girl who thinks she is in love with her comandn-Captain.  She was a bit of a flirt before her fathers death and then after, she is cold as ice.  After the crew gets to know her better, they can see that she is not the girl that she acts and wants everyone to believe she is.  She is the brains behind the crew, and she really loves her father-and her ship.  And she has it in her heart to destroy spaceadmet G. She plans on turning on the surge drive when they are close to mars to save the Atropos.\n\n## The Shadows\n\nby Jack Williamson\n\nC. J. Henderson, Chief Medical Officer of the planet Mars, stared at the two men with interest.\n\nThey walked into his consulting room with the easy stride of men who have many acquaintanceship and confidence, and who have not to fear in those who meet them. One was big and rugged; the other small and sharp-faced. He was a man of action, and in the other one of thought.\n\nThe door was left open behind them as they seated themselves, and as Henderson spoke to them.\n\n\"I've been asked to handle this case,\" Henderson explained, \"and you have come to me, and that settles the matter. I believe it will be simpler for you all if you tell me frankly how the trouble started.\"\n\nThe big man was the first to speak. \"It was when we were at the 'Red Jack' down in the town of Quatia\u2014a week ago today, I think it was. I'd been drinking some of the planet's wonderful black drink\u2014which I've now got to the point where it can't hurt me, but I can't get used to it; I never did like strong medicine\u2014so I was feeling pretty gay. I went on an 'exploring' expedition, and came on that girl. You know the story about the girl in the'red dress' and how she'd make the stars and everything else disappear if you told her the right story and were good and strong.\"\n\n\"I met her first,\" said the smaller man, \"but soon I found out what she wanted, and I went after her. There ain't a girl on the whole planet I can't tell 'bout the starry skies; I never knowed there was any on Earth who did know any better. So I walked in on the kid a couple of times, and she kept giving up, and I never knowed such a girl before; she didn't have the least bit of resistance, she liked the stuff so well, and just as I was thinking how I was going to keep her from getting it, somebody else turned up, and he\u2014well, he did a lot.\"\n\nThe doctor looked first at the big man, then at the other, waiting for them to speak further\u2014for some word from the backstage that would explain the whole story.\n\nThe big man said, \"Just about then I was getting madder'n a coyote, and I wanted to go after 'em\u2014they were right outside the place\u2014so I went for the big guy, and when he went down, I went for the little one right behind him. We started to fight, and then we heard a sort of crack...then I remember feeling sort of queer\u2014I felt that somebody had taken hold of me and pulled me apart and made a big hole, then I knew that I had done it, and I looked at the other fellow. He didn't seem to be alive, but just a second after, when I looked again, the lights went on and he came over to me. He said to me, 'It was an accident, but we got to get out of town right away.' That was what he said.\"\n\n* * * *\n\n\"Then we had a time getting away,\" the big man went on, \"the guy who'd done the killing was all for leaving the dead, but I found out that they had an extra supply of'star-stuff' down on the planet, and that was the only reason we didn't all get the same treatment I think now that they just didn't know what they'd got hold of; they just thought it was something they could use and not go bust themselves, so we headed for our ship and left the dead behind.\"\n\n\"We had to fight our way along,\" said the other man, \"the ship was there, but the town fell in on top of it, and we didn't know what they were until the guy who had killed the other fellow, just got the best of everybody and we found out that they were a gang of killers. So we were lucky after that to get away alive, and had",

Thank you, Tom. Also, I'm very proud at how good an editing job he did, and proud to be part of such a wonderful publisher and team. Thank you, David Pomerico for the amazing cover design work, and to all the guys at Tor Books.\n\nAdditionally, at the very beginning of the book's existence\u2014when I couldn't even imagine how the story could continue\u2014some very helpful remarks from the lovely and sweet Jaine Fenn\u2014who was, at that point, my agent\u2014were the catalyst for me to continue with the story and not give up. I will never forget her helpful words from the very beginning; Jaine, thank you so very much. To this day, it feels like they'll never be forgotten.\n\nThank you very much, too, to my lovely wife for being with me all the way through, always supporting and encouraging my work, and especially for being always there for me at that very hard time\u2014during the finishing of this book\u2014when it took all of my heart and soul. Thank you, my dear wife. You're the best!\n\nSome of the names in this book are a bit \"exotic\" for the British reader. If they do ring a bell it is probably thanks to my friend and former editor Patrick Samphire, who encouraged me to research and include such references and names.\n\nI would also like to give a special mention to the writer John Varley, whose name is on the cover of this book, where he graciously contributed some words of support for my work. Thank you so much, John! I'm also grateful to my friend and author Paul Di Filippo, who gave me his valuable thoughts when I was in a bit of a dilemma regarding a big moment in this book. You both are great friends, and I consider it a great privilege and an honor to know both of you. Both of you are wonderful people all along, as I mention them.\n\nLast but not least, thank you to Robert Holdstock, author of _The Bear and the Nightingale_, who\u2014again, at the beginning of my writing career\u2014also was a wonderful support and, more than I could put into words\u2014did one of those very important things that all writers dream of: he truly believed in what I wrote, and showed amazing faith in it. It is also, I think, a true compliment when an author of the scope and imagination of Robert Holdstock says that about someone else's writing, and, John Varley does, too, to say the least. It must have meant a lot to you, Robert, to hear it! I thank you from my heart!\n\nAt the initial writing of this book\u2014while I was still living in Greece, and had only just gotten the support of Jaine in my dream to become a writer\u2014many wonderful people also believed in what I wrote: my mother, brother, sisters, brother-in-law, and friends in general. Thank you so much for all your love and encouragement; especially to my sisters for the many hours of reading my work in the early stages. And to Jodi-Ann, and the girls out there\u2014thanks so much for your constant support and friendship.\n\n#\n\nThe following story has been told to me more than once, and I am sure it is true because the people I have met have confirmed it over and again.",
    "71": "Evelyn is willing to sacrifice her father's life to delay the detonation of the bomb. But she knows that she could use her knowledge of the mentors of either globe to escape and live. Why does she do what she does?\nCOUNCIL   \nOF  \nDARLING! \nCouncil   \nof  \nDarl \nDarl had been a small and quiet boy with a great zest for life. His great eyes were wide with wonder, and he was full of laughter. Nowadays, when he ran about in the woods with the other boys of the Outfit, they were all quick and clever and full of bravado, all of them ready to give an order for a dangerous stunt. But to Darl it was fun. There was danger, but none at all of responsibility. His eyes laughed and his lips opened into a big smile, and he felt young again.\n\nA wild band of lads, Darl and the others ran into a party of the Outfitters, not many miles from the base. They saw some little fellows in a hollow with a machine gun, so they ran down to give the gun a hot box. Darl was so full of bravado that he never looked for a return shot. It was all in fun, and a challenge to the other gang.\n\nWhat did the boys in the Outfit say to Darl?\n\nWhen the boys saw Darl and they began to run, saying he was a coward and should learn to fight, they started to throw rocks at him. But what with the noise in the hills and the excitement of the thing, very few of them hit Darl. That made him even braver.\n\nNow, however, an Outfitter told Darl that he shouldn't have come so far alone, and that he must have taken up with a wrong outfit.\n\nWhat did Darl answer, when the Outfitter told him he was wrong and that he should go back with the Outfit?\n\nI don't remember. But when I came out from under the rocks and started for the machine gun, I was sure he was right, and that I had made a mistake.\n\nWhen the boys saw what was going on, they were wild with rage. They had wanted to go around to the other Outfit. They were angry when they saw Darl. It made them mad. They rushed out at him, not one by one, but all at once, waving rifles and clubs.\n\nDid Darl run away?\n\nI don't remember running away, no. But something or other did happen to me when I was running, that makes me feel bad when I close my eyes and see the pictures of it. What did happen to me?\n\nI don't understand the word.\n\nWhy do you close your eyes the time?\n\nI don't know, either.\n\nThe boys were wild and running at Darl. They were angry over taking him out of the gang. They had taken him out to show him how a real Outfitter behaved, and they wanted him to behave like all the rest of them. But he had been hurt and hurt a lot. He could hardly walk. But he didn't run away.\n\nWhat happened to Darl, when the boys ran out to him?\n\nI've tried to look that up a hundred times, and I don't know what it means.\n\nWhen a big fellow caught up with Darl, he said, \"Here\u2014now!\" and threw his club, and hit Darl a few times. The boy started to kick Darl. He tried to, but he couldn't. He started to run. He yelled, \"Run away!\" The other boys heard him. They came after him. They called him a coward, and they had never seen a coward\u2014not one like this, anyway. They wanted to club him, but someone stopped them. They turned on Darl again.\n\nThey stopped for a few minutes because someone was looking for them. But when he ran out of the woods and the rocks, they went back. They were angry, and they saw where Darl was. The boys said he was going to run away. They got in among him and told him that he wasn't going to run unless they told him so. They started to grab him.\n\nThey called him a coward, and they had never seen a coward. They made him stand up. They told him that they were going to cut his head off. That they'd show that he was a coward and they'd show all the other Outfit that he was one. The blood flowed into Darl's face, and his eyes bulged. He was trying to run away.\n\nWhat did Darl do, when the boys called",
    "72": "Didyak isn't an important personage. He's a Tr'en; at least, he's one of a kind, and probably the only one of his kind on the planet. Korvin calls him \"The Ruler's eyes and ears.\" It's doubtful if the Ruler knows about him specifically, as there's no mention of any other spies or intelligence agents; Korvin simply makes it part of the process by which he gains access to the ship. It's obvious, of course, that Didyak is a spy; Korvin is just trying to make himself known to the Ruler's chief servant.\n\nQuestions and Answers Copyright \u00a9 1995 by Lawrence M.

It was the morning of the battle, and the snow lay untramped and untrod in the village of Westbridge. No one in the streets or on the pavements gave a thought to snow or winter. The village was busy. It had been so busy for weeks. During lunch hour many of the women took a walk to the shop to buy tea, because of the snow; their husbands were usually at work and weren't allowed to leave the collieries until they had eaten. Even the young people were out in the shops.\n\nBut to the right of the churchyard they gathered in a great throng, for there, before the west door, their eyes were turned. The village school was in that building, for it was there a small, grey granite statue of a schoolteacher, in faded brown coat and faded red cap, stood on a pedestal. It was a good likeness and it was an old likeness, as old as memories of the men and women who had stood about at the corner of the village looking up at it.\n\nOn the day of victory, perhaps it was because they wanted to, or perhaps it was the fact that they had to, they did look. It was the time for school prizes to be awarded. After the service they turned their steps to the schoolhouse.\n\nThe men's faces were set forward into a harsh and brutal expression, but their eyes looked at the school and their children. And their mothers and young wives stared also at the old statue.\n\nAs the throng surged along the pavement, through the school door, all were talking because most of them said the same thing.\n\n'They'll give her the first one, if we ask. We'll have to ask them.'\n\nIt sounded more as a wish than a necessity, but to the women many things were necessary.\n\nBut they would never do such a thing!\n\nMrs Rouncewell, the headmistress, was a big woman with",
    "73": "\nDidyak is a Tr'en guard, responsible for Korvin's capture and imprisonment. He is a minor character in Book One of this trilogy, KORVIN OF ETERNITY, a nonperson with only one role\u2014and a role so minor that he doesn't even know it himself. In the human world of the twentieth century, he'd not have had the authority to be a guard\u2014not if he were a prisoner himself\u2014but if he'd ever really been a prisoner, it would be inconceivable\u2014in the Tr'en world\u2014that he would ever have been taken by force. He's the perfect tool for the Tr'en Ruler, because he's not used to the Tr'en way of thinking.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy does Didyak want to have a quiet word with Korvin?\n\nAnswer:\n\nDidyak has been ordered to fetch Korvin from where he crashed the ship on the planet. Korvin knows only what Didyak tells him, but he's sure that the Ruler wants information and that information is not what Didyak thinks it is.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWho were the experts on logic that Korvin asked to clarify the Tr'en government?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Ruler sent for an advisory group of experts to look into Korvin's statements about their government, because Korvin didn't believe that their government existed. However, in the Tr'en universe, there is no government except for the Ruler, and so Korvin believes that the Tr'en experts on logic have agreed that there must be a governor.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is a chulad?\n\nAnswer:\n\nChulad is a little pet like a deathwatch beetle, the native equivalent of a housecat. It was probably made by genetic engineering; the chulad has only one function in the Tr'en civilization\u2014to show that the Ruler is supreme, by the sheer implausibility of the creature.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWho are Achilles and the tortoise?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe most common model of logical paradox from the ancient literature of Earth, the famous story of Achilles who was killed by Zeus. An earlier generation of Earth scientists had been interested in the concept of paradox as a mathematical problem.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the meaning of the name Korvin?\n\nAnswer:\n\nKorvin (sometimes corbin ) means \"prisoner\" in the language of the planet. It was one of the few concepts to come from the early days of the Earth sciences, when the problem of life on other planets was the primary one before Earth space travel was developed.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat does the author mean by the sentence the Ruler will not be confused?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Tr'en Rulers are not intelligent\u2014at least, not in the sense that anything on Earth would mean the expression. They aren't so much stupid as the reverse: they have a perfectly rigid mathematical way of looking at the universe. Their minds are as pure as the logic of mathematics itself; but they don't think like that, with no flexibility or change in their conclusions. Korvin needs to escape or perish.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat does the statement we cannot be confused by such means mean and does there seem to be any truth to it?\n\nAnswer:\n\nParadox is a common tool of the science of mathematics\u2014mathematical \"truth\" being more important than \"reality.\" The Tr'en must have an equivalent of mathematical truth, and the Tr'en way of talking is based on words for the mathematical truth, as well as for other truths and for lies. According to their viewpoint, they can't be tricked. However, that's not a sure thing. The Tr'en world is far from the only one in the cosmos, and different cultures use the same tools in different ways. The Ruler is convinced that Korvin is guilty; that's all the evidence he needs, but it leaves the question of motive unanswered. He intends at some point in the future to take Korvin into court. But that's a dangerous idea.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhy does Korvin ask the Ruler if their government is joined in a supreme government?\n\nAnswer:\n\nKorvin needs to be confused, but not about his crimes. He must be confused about the logical nature of his government. It's one thing for a planet to have a government that its people are unable to read into; it's quite another to have no government at all, as the Tr'en believe. And, by pointing out that they are already confused about it, Korvin can confuse him further.\n\nQuestion:",
    "74": "\nDidyak is the Tr'en who captures Korvin, locks him in the cell, tells him he is destined to die within thirteen hours and goes away for some purpose.\n\nComments:\n\nDo andyak. The did and ik are verbs and are almost interchangeable. Doyak means tell or tell somebody, and ik means come to or come to somebody.\n\nDidyak therefore means tell somebody or come to somebody.\n\nThis definition is not very helpful in the book; but the word is used in later paragraphs, in a slightly different sense.\n\nDoyak and his race mean nothing to the story.\n\nThis definition could be better.\n\nLarry has said that his books are like the films of Douglas Sirk, a kind of melodrama.\n\nThis could apply to this definition, but would not apply to the preceding definitions.\n\nLarry has said that he doesn't do much of the writing. He finds a great proportion of the details difficult. They're hard on the eyes.\n\nYou can tell that this definition has become important to the story. The same kind of language is used afterwards, and this definition has something to do with a later paragraph.\n\nLarry has said that sometimes he doesn't know quite where he wishes to go with a book he is writing until he gets there.\n\nThis definition relates to a later paragraph. But it also has something to do with a later paragraph.\n\nLarry has said that the Tr'en language is the logical next thing to mathematics. It is much more rigorous.\n\nIt has something to do with the preceding definitions.\n\nLarry said that the Tr'en could be joined with the rest of the planets.\n\nThis should have been a warning to Larry.\n\nLarry's job is to find out about other planets and join them up in a single government. It is supposed to be impossible for the Tr'en to work out how to join the planets together. It is known that the Tr'en are going to try to join up with this star system. Any plan to join the planets together involves Korvin. That is all there is to it in the book. That is all there has to be. No more explanation is needed about the Tr'en. It would be nice if there was, but there isn't.\n\nThe next chapter continues with the story.\n\n## 2.\n\n## TRANSLATION\n\nIn translation you get literal meaning, word for word\u2014\n\nBut not true meaning.\n\nAnd space translation gets worse.\n\nThen language becomes a foreign thing\u2014\n\nAnd nothing makes sense.\n\nIt happened\u2014\n\nAnd it kept happening, again and again.\n\nIt happened again, and again, and again.\n\nOn Earth that was\u2014\n\nBut in my head it was\u2014\n\nAlways happening all the same.\n\nI was thinking, of course\u2014\n\nAnd when I stopped thinking, the thinking kept happening.\n\nThere was always the same trouble\u2014\n\nA man was always trying to get out of my head.\n\nIt's been happening for years now\u2014\n\nAlways in translation,\n\nThe same thing every time.\n\nHe asked questions\u2014\n\nAnd made demands.\n\nHe didn't know what he was doing\u2014\n\nAnd he was always doing the wrong thing.\n\nHe looked at me sideways\u2014\n\nAnd he was always trying to trick me.\n\nThen, too, he was trying to make friends.\n\nThen, also, he was trying to lie.\n\nWhen he saw I'd seen through him, he made more strange demands\u2014\n\nAnd still he didn't know what he was doing.\n\nHe asked me\u2014\n\nIf I were ready to do the job.\n\nWhen I started thinking again, he thought he'd fooled me\u2014\n\nHe was trying to trick me.\n\nThen I got fed up and told him how to do it.\n\nWhen he wouldn't listen, I told him again to do it himself.\n\n I was right.\n\nHe saw that I hadn't been tricking him.\n\nHe admitted that he wasn't smart enough to be allowed to do it.\n\nHe wanted to know how the job could be done.\n\nI told him he couldn't do it, not with the way he thought.\n\nHe wanted to know if I could do it.\n\nI told him I hadn't been lying.\n\nI would do the job;\n\nHe couldn't do the things that he thought he had to do.\n\nHe wanted to know what it would cost.\n\nI told him it would cost him his life\u2014\n\nBut not",
    "75": "DIDYAK, AS HIS NAME SUGGESTS, is one of the Tr'en. He is a member of the Council, although in so far as Korvin sees him he is \"out on a limb,\" as Korvin puts it.\n\nDidyak is used to illustrate Korvin's view of society; the Tr'en way of life is so efficient that even the most trivial of social matters is handled efficiently. The Tr'en believe that there can be no good, rational, social system that requires a hierarchy of some sort; a logical progression of events should result in efficient behavior.\n\nDidyak's job is, at first, to bring about a meeting between Korvin and the Tr'en Ruler; because of this he is called upon to serve as translator.\n\nIt is because he is a member of the Council that Korvin accepts him as a Tr'en. The Tr'en are efficient, and their way of life runs by logic and fact, but it's a fact that, \"We're not all like you, in all respects. Some of us aren't like you at all.\" Their efficiency is in the physical world, however; they leave their own minds to chance.\n\nThis is what Korvin means by \"slipshod.\" It is his fault about Didyak's, because Korvin's first question is \"Who's Didyak?\" There is no place for \"Why Are You Here?\" in Tr'en\u2014and Didyak never gets the answer.\n\n## THE DEEP END\n\n### BY\n\nJAY ALLAN\n\nILLUSTRATED BY\n\nSCHOENHERR\n\nWhen this one finally came together, we were all a little apprehensive. It's a little different than our usual style of doing things. It may take a few readings to get used to it. But I promise this will turn out to be another of our big winners! I hope so, anyway. And Schoenherr has a really unique, almost other-worldly, style that brings the entire story, and the underlying theme, to a kind of startling and memorable conclusion!\n\n\u2014JAY\n\nTHE BARREN PLANET'S DARKNESS RANGES deep; in the distance, stars seemed to be suspended like frozen spheres; nothing stirred, not even the air.\n\nThe figure sat upright at his radio receiver and stared intently into the screen, a small, dark patch in that immensity of space and time. The man's face was hard\u2014the features like cutouts from a plasticine model.\n\nThe figure stiffened, his hands still gripping the device. And something began to happen. The machine emitted a thin, high pitch, and the figure's ears seemed to burn and throb. It had never happened before. The creature's body seemed to go rigid, and he stared even more intensely at his glowing radio screen and spoke in a croaking voice. He had seen some of the other men at the base stop suddenly and stare at odd objects in their hands, their faces distorted. The figure shook his head, and the machine continued to emit the strange, piercing, squeal. And for a moment, it seemed as if he were fighting off a great sleep, a sleep made worse by that strange cry and the throbbing in his ears.\n\nThen the figure gave a cry, a sort of bellowing scream, and his body spasmed violently, and his face contorted.\n\nAn hour later the figure began running wildly through the base area in a frenzy, pursued by guards. The creature was gibbering in a voice a mere semblance of human, so terrible that no one who heard it could tell if it was pain or joy. The guards fought futilely trying to catch the fleeing figure, who ran in circles and was almost directly behind a parked tractor when one of the pursuing men, the brawny guard named Pazin, finally caught him in a flying tackle and fell over backward on the earth. Pazin stood up immediately and ran toward the creature with a short but powerful weapon in his hands\u2014\n\nHe was too late. The creature had disappeared beneath the tractor. When Pazin got near it, he stopped and stared at the thing. And it gave a terrible, piercing cry, a whistle like water going over a waterfall, and the guard's face seemed to change. His body shook violently and some red fluid began to come from his throat. He gave a yell and ran wildly out of the area.\n\nAnd this was all the last man at the base saw before he too disappeared and there was nobody left.\n\nThe tractor had a thick black glass bubble over it, through which the guard had watched in amazement, and his body didn't emerge once",
    "76": "\nLarry M.   Harris\n\nI guess it is rather obvious, but there really isn't anything subtle about it\u2014you can't translate one language into another without a fair amount of effort. And Korvin is bored out of his mind. So there was a logical reason for an escape by the use of translation, I suppose.\n\nQuestion:\n\nThe Tr'en are, of course, a logical people; they accept only logical explanations. Is there any point, you feel, that is being made in the story by a race of such rigid logic?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI guess there isn't any answer to your question. It's true: the Tr'en are logical as hell because it serves the purpose. They take in information, classify it with mathematical precision and turn it into a new pattern, an orderly one. There really isn't anything more to the Tr'en.\n\nQuestion:\n\nDo the \"experts\" actually seem to be doing anything?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThey are merely the machinery of government. But it doesn't really serve any purpose that you can think of. The Tr'en are governed in the way it is described, and the machinery of government merely carries out a well-defined set of orders. What possible use the experts in logic are is obvious, I'm afraid. Logic is the basis for science; but when what's accepted is just a mathematical formula, rather than a living fact\u2014well, it doesn't seem particularly useful. But it is.\n\nQuestion:\n\nIn that case, why is the book of logic not kept in their society at all?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt is because there is nothing they can possibly learn from it that would be useful to them. To them, a logic theorem is a theorem: it is just a description of what they believe is true. Without a reason, it is useless, of course; to me, it's the entire basis for any sort of living knowledge\u2014and that, of course, was precisely the value I wanted to emphasize. They were a logical race: but the logic was limited to the physical universe; they had no insights into the logical universe of men, or they would never have come to Earth.\n\nQuestion:\n\nThe Ruler of the Tr'en\u2014it isn't obvious to me what exactly he is like, and I have no idea whether the story is intended to be ambiguous on this point. Could you clarify it for me?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI don't see why there is any need to clarify the Ruler of the Tr'en; he just happens to be the Ruler, that's all. He is a race; he rules over his people, and that defines him.\n\nQuestion:\n\nA Tr'en is over seven feet tall and correspondingly broad\u2014how did you decide on that size? It seems to me that there must be a very interesting reason, in one of two possibilities: either Korvin is an extremely tall man, or the Ruler is in reality quite a small and puny creature. Which?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI don't know the answer to your question, either. The answer you choose depends upon your point of reference, I guess\u2014but there isn't supposed to be anything subtle about it. His size is a fact of life which Korvin notes, that's all.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow realistic is the rest of the story\u2014I think I can guess, but can anybody else? Just what is a human \"child\" in the story\u2014an elderly man?\n\nAnswer:\n\nWell, Korvin was thirty-ish; it only tells us that Earth children could grow up to be that size.\n\nQuestion:\n\nHow are you using the psi-powers in science fiction fiction?\n\nAnswer:\n\nAbout the same as usual, I guess. Korvin isn't really psi-powered in any way; he's just having a hard time with the Tr'en guards. He thinks he has psi-powers, but he's wrong.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the point of the story? Is it a comment on the relative ineffectiveness of psi-powers?\n\nAnswer:\n\nNo, I think it's just a comment on life in the near future\u2014that everything will be routine and dull when it isn't horribly exciting, and that all the excitement is likely to be over in twenty or twenty-five years, no matter what happens. The Tr'en were efficient; they were in the process of developing faster-than-light travel\u2014it seemed pretty unlikely that they were going to settle the stars, or let us join in. But they were too logic-bound internally to develop the techniques of the rest of the universe, and too efficient physically",
    "77": "In any language, there are words that don't have exact counterparts in the language you're translating from or into. For example, the word for \"dog\"\u2014chien, in French, but Hund in German, and kanines in Sanskrit\u2014can be used in several quite different ways in different languages, yet we still get the same idea out of it because we share enough of a common language. Likewise, there are words like \"pregnant,\" \"eaten,\" \"cold,\" and \"sister,\" that we don't use very differently, no matter the language. Translation, then, is the process of taking a word whose meaning is clear to a reasonably advanced speaker of the common language, and finding the best equivalent in the language you're translating into. The important thing is that the closest equivalent be given for the foreign word; a truer translation is the one where the closest equivalent is found, especially considering the cultural background and point of view.\n\n\nA NEW ENGLAND CLUB STORY\n\nThe New England Club\u2014the oldest club in Boston\u2014was founded in 1883 by a collection of enterprising young members of the Boston Brahmins, an important element in the social life of Boston. The club was formed chiefly to be a place where people could get together and share in conversation, a diversion from the work-a-day world. For these gentlemen of Boston, pleasure was very important, and in more recent years the trend has been toward an increasing interest in such sports as tennis, dancing, swimming, and other amusements.\n\nIn the present year of 1935, the membership numbers around 2,500, and the club owns an athletic field at Revere Beach, another at Winthrop Beach, and, of course, a bowling alley in downtown Boston. Some of the oldest and finest traditions of American life are kept at the New England Club. At the beginning of every New Year's Holiday, for instance, a special dinner is given, open to members only. During the Christmas season Christmas trees, beautifully decorated by the members, are placed in the various rooms of the club. On the Club's summer days, the members are served the Club's well-known lemonade, iced tea, and eggnogs. No other club in Boston or elsewhere can boast of such a successful past or such a glowing future.\n\nIn the New England Club story, \"An Eye for an Eye,\" by Charles Dana Gibson, Charles has come home to Massachusetts from a far-away place and is once again a happy bachelor bachelor living in his own apartment. A young widow has just moved into apartment two. At first she seems rather stand-offish but once she begins to open up, the two of them become good friends. A sudden twist of fate puts them in a quandary when a young man tries to pick her up.\n\nCharles has an eye for an eye.\n\nFor Mrs. Van Riel, for instance, was sitting alone in her apartment, reading a little and doing nothing, and it came to me that I didn't know her very well and it occurred to me that if I did, we could be friends. I wondered about her just as much as she wondered about me and we could have been friends.\n\nFor I could see Mrs. Van Riel and the way she sat as she did in that room and yet there was a great deal about her that I didn't know and I could see her and yet I did not know her.\n\n\u2014CHARLES C.

    "78": "\nTranslation, by definition, refers  to a conversion of one language into another without losing the meaning of the original.\n\nTranslation is an act of understanding, in any and all languages. Translators usually strive to understand the basic language they deal with. They seek to find a metaphor or a symbol for something in their own language or culture which will be as exact a replica in the language or culture in which they deal as possible. This is the first step in translation: understanding.\n\nMetaphor is the transformation of a concept from one language into another, usually without any loss of meaning. A metaphor often takes the form of an equivalent. An example, in this case, is the word space-time used to translate time-space.\n\nSpace-time is a much more descriptive term than time-space for time, and it describes better the nature of the translation: not only are objects in space-time moving but time-space is also time. This is obvious from the example of time-space as a metaphor:\n\nSpace-time is  = spacetime  = length \u00d7 time\nwhere speed and velocity are interchangeable.\n\nThe symbol for length is an arbitrary choice. It could be any one of several words describing length because the fact that there is another word for length at all indicates that there is something to describe. Metaphor has been achieved.\n\nThe word for time is another arbitrary choice because all that is needed for time is the absence of length. In this case, the word for time and nothing else. Metaphor has been achieved.\n\nOther, more subtle, steps have to be taken in translating from one language to another, and no two language translations are entirely the same.\n\nThe significance of translation is revealed in Korvin's story. The Tr'en were highly efficient in translating objects into a meaningful environment. It is their inability to translate from one language to another which causes their \"death.\" It is in trying to force their own concept of space-time\u2014a term which, after all, the Tr'en do not understand\u2014into a language system which is alien to them\u2014an impossible task\u2014that they cause their own destruction.\n\nThe logical flaw in their explanation and the obvious contradiction in the explanation come about because the Tr'en do not understand the concept of one language. They thought they were in a room and they wanted to find the door. They had no word for door. In their own language, there was only one word for room. They did not know they were in one room, and they asked for it.\n\nThe door represented another concept to them and it was not equivalent in their mental universe. They needed no other metaphor, but their inability to understand the metaphor causes them to refuse to try the transformation themselves.\nFor Terry Carr & The Locus Awards\n\nThanks\n\nThe idea for this story came to me last year when I bought a very expensive vacuum cleaner.\n\nThanks are due to Terry Carr, for more reasons than I could ever hope to list, and to my parents.

Unlike all the other races, which had lived comfortably on their planets, with hardly any contact at all with other men\u2014and with each other\u2014the Tr'en were on the verge of setting off for the stars. They had ships; they were developing faster-than-light drives, which would make space travel practically routine. They had the science to do both, and they were logical, efficient beings.\n\nIt was inevitable, therefore, that in due course one of the Tr'en ships would find its way to Earth; there had been only the b",
    "79": "\nIn space-type translation, the translator takes two completely dissimilar stories and forces them into exactly identical sets of linguistic structures. This is possible if the translator is willing to sacrifice accuracy to the point of near-literal translation of the structure, while carefully maintaining meaning. In language translation, you lose accuracy entirely. To recover it, you must have at your disposal a lot more information on the subject of the translation; by the time you've translated a passage, meaning has often vanished entirely.\n\nTransformation of Identity:\nThe Last Word\n\nBONKERS\n\nBy\n\nELMORE LYON\n\nBonkers: the title isn't a euphemism; that is the writer, and that he does not lack humor was a fact I soon learned.\n\nIt starts out with one of those old chestnut of stories, the sort which always tells how the doctor cured the ailing man\u2014what was so special about this one was the manner the man went from hero to zero, and it only took a few paragraphs to come to that point. His name was Boney Meehan, and he was a gambler and a heavy drinker, and in the time he spent at a high-class poker game, he was winning so many millions, his luck became legendary. If he lost, it wasn't to any normal human opponent, but to a machine. It was, after all, a machine that had stolen all the money that the gamblers had been betting on. There was only one way to win money from a machine, and that was to die. When this happened, it wasn't to anyone else, but to Meehan. And the reason for that was because he was dead\u2014in some undefined manner\u2014at the time he was playing poker. The plot was simple and direct; the story was a nightmare tale. When Bonkers reached the end, it was like climbing out of a hole; and, having escaped from that hole, I was left feeling not only satisfied, but quite hopeful that I wouldn't be dropped into another in the near future.\n\nNow for the writer. His name is Lyon\u2014Elmore Lyon\u2014a rather commonplace author, who has written a number of mysteries for the various pulps without ever rising far above the runtish-pulp status. But I wasn't thinking of him during those hours I spent reading Bonkers\u2014I was thinking about that ending. It left me asking myself: Had the writer, in some way, come into contact with the forces of the supernatural in his short career? Certainly the story was too fantastic to be the product of any of the usual rational men who write for the pulps, but was there any basis which could be built upon to account for such a fantastic tale?\n\nThe second story in this unusual little collection was also told in the form of a nightmare fantasy\u2014and as the title indicates, I think this one was intended somewhat as an afterthought.\nThe Story of Shamus MacTavish\n\nBy\n\nELMORE LYON\n\nIllustrated by\n\nPHILLIP J. R. KEELER\n\nI knew Shamus MacTavish. He was from the North, and he came from a small fishing village; he was a bit strange, and the local people were aware of it. His mother died in childbirth, and his father, when he found out, didn't blame the infant; he blamed the wife. It was, therefore, expected that Shamus MacTavish, who had an older sister and a younger brother, would show a lot of the qualities of a genius. But he was slow and stubborn, and when he did finally show what genius could do, he was quite prepared to let his younger brother do the rest. He had the makings of a poet; it was just that the world, in which he lived, wasn't exactly conducive to that sort of thing. Nor would he let the others see much of that genius, either\u2014in fact, he managed to live out the period of his life without his ability developing at all. He got a job as a fisherman when it was obvious that it wasn't taking after one of the higher forms of civilization; he lived down to what he could do and then no more. But now he was dead.\nHe was living where the village was, and he was living all alone. He was working where the village was, and he was living alone.\n\nOne night there was a storm, and the storm was unusual\u2014it brought with it the worst kind of weather you could ever imagine. When he worked as a fisherman during the day, he knew the other fellows would talk about how dangerous the wind and the sea could make a person feel; but this storm was much worse. It came from the north, like all storms do in the north"
