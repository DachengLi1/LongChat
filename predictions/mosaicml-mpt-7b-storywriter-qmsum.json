The team was at an early design stage and as a result of a large number of different design possibilities, the team was beginning to encounter a large amount of conflict.\n\nWhen the design team's vision for the final product wasn't clear and precise, each proposal presented by the team came with a range of costs and benefits. Each proposal could be argued as being the most desirable and practical.\n\nThe game design project was a high profile, high budget project.\n\nThe Project Leader was adamant about having a product that looked sleek, modern, simple and easy to use. This included the remote control. The final product was being sold to a group of young, urban professionals. The users were well educated\u2014they expected modern design and wanted to feel as though they had invested their money in a sleek, beautiful and attractive device.\n\nThe Project Leader was frustrated with the fact that none of the design proposals went with the clean, sleek concept that she wanted.\n\n## CHAPTER 13\n\n## What are the goals of a design review meeting?\n\n* This is a question that came from a real life design team: Project management for high profile and ambitious game design project.\n\nThe design team's goal was to settle on a basic design direction which addressed all of the cost, usability and visual concerns.\n\nThe team was at an early design stage. They wanted to make sure that the final product would be elegant, practical and aesthetically pleasing. The design team was well versed in contemporary design.\n\nThe team had many different ideas for how the final product should look, but each of them had different drawbacks and advantages, and all of them were expensive. The team was working with a tight budget.\n\n## CHAPTER 14\n\n## How does good design inspire the creative?\n\n* This is a question that came from an entrepreneurial design team: Project management for a video game design project.\n\nThe team was being pressured into coming up with a design option as soon after an idea had originated as they could because the concept had already been discussed with the management team.\n\nA lot of time was being wasted because the team didn't understand the concept as clearly as they should have.\n\nThe team was trying to understand the different ways to present a game using the available technology. The team had been working in a small, cramped studio.\n\nThe team was being paid extra to stay till dawn if need-be, but was only getting limited access to the equipment they needed.\n\nThe team was worried that they'd turn in their design sketches too late and lose out to a competitor.\n\nThe game was a first person shooter set in a post apocalyptical world. The player was a bounty hunter who had to track down corrupt government officials.\n\n## CHAPTER 15\n\n## Which problem should be considered first: cost or function?\n\n* This is a question that comes from a project management team: Project management for high-profile, high budget project, and it came from a high-pressure situation.\n\nThe project management team had been given the project at the last moment.\n\nThe team was at a very early phase in the project. The team had many ideas for how the remote control could be redesigned to be the most aesthetically beautiful and functional. The team was well versed in contemporary industrial design.\n\nThe Project Manager wanted to have a remote control that could be both aesthetically beautiful and easy to use. She was adamant that the team should come up with one simple design by the end of the week.\n\nThe team had many different ideas for how the final product could be designed.\n\nThe team was working with a tight budget.\n\n## CHAPTER 16\n\n## Why should design meetings be scheduled for early in the project?\n\n* This is a question that came from a project management team: Project management for a video game design project.\n\nThe team was at an early design stage. The team was having many design issues in terms of how the players should move around. The team was trying to figure out what",
    "1": "\nAt the conceptual design meeting you discussed design ideas for the remote control. Marketing talked about colour and design. You proposed concepts for a light panel with different colours changing depending on where the remote is and the temperature. Rama discussed the location of the remote which is important because many people might share the remote. If they do, it also needs to know who is using it. You talked about remote controls for cars or boats. The first option was to use solar cells as the energy source. You said you could use conventional batteries instead. Industrial Designer suggested a speaker independent speech recognition which also adds technology costs. If the user wishes to make the remote more personal, he or she might do so by paying more for options like different colours for the display or material such as rubber instead of titanium.\n\nTranscript:\nMarketing: Oh. Hi there. This is Marketing Expert again. {vocalsound} The conceptual design meeting is still continuing. Are you ready?\nProject Manager: Hello. This is Participant one. {vocalsound}\nUser Interface: Ah. {vocalsound}\nMarketing: Okay let's start uh again. We have uh Sammy for the technical issue and uh again we have again Rama and uh I uh again Sammy and again Rama.\nProject Manager: Hello. This is uh\nProject Manager: Okay.\nMarketing: Who's uh who is Participant two? {vocalsound}\nSammy: Hello. This is Sammy. {vocalsound} So, ah we're ready.\nMarketing: Very good. Well, let's again take on the um the conceptual design meeting. Uh the previous one, I think it has gone well in terms of uh of ideas and uh what the team is up to. So as usual. Uh. Mm um uh this meeting is about uh the um concepts development which is very important uh the um development of the design um that we discussed before of the remote control and that will include a lot of um uh. uh. mm. I think as usual i we will have three presentations. Uh so first with Rama.\nProject Manager: Hello. Which one?\nRama: Participant two.\nProject Manager: Okay.\nRama: Uh, yes. So we would like to see what we can do in terms of design for the remote control to make it more user friendly and uh uh friendly for {disfmarker} which we discussed before the um um like L_C_D_ or L_S_D_ or interface features like buttons and so as our first idea. But we can also propose another option which might be more suitable for a more technological uh environment.\nProject Manager: Which one?\nRama: We can go for titanium remote control and we suggest a kind of remote control that has a double curved screen or double lens on the front, like L_S_D_\nProject Manager: So\n\nRama: So the idea is that um, you can use the remote control as a kind of phone.\n\nProject Manager: Uh-huh.\n\nRama: We can design it so that you can have different shapes or images or colours displayed on the screen.\n\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm.\n\nRama: Instead of using that uh what we usually use as display, these things that we put in phones like L_S_D_\n\nRama: Then we can design all kind of shapes and they would also change depending on the environment.\n\nRama: Also we can make it in some colours. {gap}\n\nProject Manager: This this sounds interesting\n\nRama: And as the remote control will be visible in the house then it will be visible in the environment and we can also add like a speaker or speaker independent speech recognition.\n\nProject Manager: Mm-hmm.\nRama: We will have to put other sensors and this will make the device more expensive to make\n\nRama: But it's a nice kind of trend that you can see and you use on phones or uh uh any kind of.............\n\nProject Manager: Okay.\n\nRama: So we can experiment on.........\n\nProject Manager: Okay.\n\nRama: So you can use it with your car remote control or your boat and it's something different from the normal design.\nProject Manager: Hmm?\n\nRama: Maybe like uh uh mm\n\nRama: or some of these things that might be used....\n\nProject Manager: Okay. And uh what about this uh double curved remote control concept. What do you recommend to do?\n\nRama: It's",
    "2": "\nI :\n\nMarketing is going to focus on looking for inspiration in trends and to invent a trend by themselves, using different ideas. Their approach should be:\n\nA. They are not following\n\nB. It seems they can\n\nC. Trends tend to be common across all industries\n\nD. Trends do not have to be followed\n\nThis is the correct and best answer\n\nProject Manager: Okay, now everyone can take this time to begin working on the prototype.\n\nUser Interface: Okay, so uh I don't really need to say much as it seems all clear. We are to explore two options.\n\nIndustrial Designer: Mm.\n\nUser Interface: I already started on this a little bit.\n\nUser Interface: But Rama's going to take you guys through this thing with the look of the remote control, uh which is probably one of most important things.\nMarketing: Hmm\n\nMarketing: Hmm, I was just uh not uh very sure what we can do.\nUser Interface: You can do whatever you like\n\nMarketing: Hmm\n\nMarketing: Yeah. Yep, okay\n\nUser Interface: But we have to think about this {disfmarker} and this {gap}\n\nMarketing: We are, in fact\n\nUser Interface: So we can make the remote control like\n\nUser Interface: It's a matter of look and feel and if the remote control is like\n\nMarketing: A bit difficult to put both on the same remote control\n\nUser Interface: It'll be fine\n\nMarketing: Because we're not going to have only a design function that controls the remote control\n\nUser Interface: Okay?\n\nMarketing: You know, I'm sure all of you guys already\n\nUser Interface: Yeah. We are going to\n\nMarketing: We'll see at the end\n\nUser Interface: Yep\n\nMarketing: Uh yeah. Yep. Yep, okay.\n\nUser Interface: Yeah\n\nMarketing: Yeah\n\nUser Interface: Yep\n\nMarketing: It's a matter of look and feel uh, so\n\nUser Interface: It could be shaped like some kind of fruit or vegetable\n\nMarketing: Yeah, I think it could\n\nUser Interface: Yep.\n\nMarketing: Yeah\n\nUser Interface: We can do that.\n\nMarketing: I hope it's alright\n\nUser Interface: Okay. I really don't know what to do.\n\nMarketing: Hmm.\n\nUser Interface: You know. Yes. It's all fine\n\nMarketing: I think we have to\n\nUser Interface: You know we have to ask them they make them and I hope they ask us the same questions.\n\nMarketing: Yeah. Okay. Yep\n\nUser Interface: Yep\n\nUser Interface: You want to go for something like plastic\n\nMarketing: Hmm, because uh we can make the whole body with a smooth and like what I said and then we can use\n\nUser Interface: Uhuh-huh\n\nMarketing: With some kind of colours depending on uh\n\nMarketing: Depending on the temperature\n\nUser Interface: Like the colour that matches to your outfit.\n\nMarketing: What do you mean?\n\nUser Interface: You know they always have blue\n\nMarketing: Okay\n\nMarketing: I was uh just thinking about\n\nUser Interface: Okay\n\nMarketing: Like\n\nUser Interface: In some colours they match to your outfit\n\nMarketing: And we want to have some\n\nMarketing: Let's make our\n\nUser Interface: Yes\n\nMarketing: You know, the user interface we're going to make really beautiful\n\nMarketing: You know, uh we can have a touch pad screen\n\nUser Interface: Okay\n\nMarketing: I thought we were doing\n\nMarketing: This remote control should be really beautiful oh. So I didn't read that page. Okay. If you like\n\nUser Interface: Yeah.

I would like to begin by discussing the user interface design for a new type of remote control.

We have scheduled a meeting for fifteen minutes. I would like to begin by discussing the user interface design for a new type of remote control. The product we develop will have to be fancy as the designer says, but also it has to contain technological innovations such as voice recognition. I think that we need to do quite good job on the design since we have to put some chips inside the remote control. We still have several challenges here. First of all it has to follow the trend if you want to be successful, so we should not make it look old-fashioned but also it has to be innovative and modern and user friendly. I wonder if we can develop a design that can solve these challenges.\n\nMarketing:\n\nMarketing:\n\nSammy: Hello, it's Sammy. My turn. I think you're going to do a very good job on this project. I'm glad that we are going to use clay modelling in this project since I believe that that kind of design encourages people to think freely.

This isn't just your run-of-the-mill rom-com, though, there's also intrigue, betrayal, space travel, and other planets! Science fiction with romance at its core\u2014the perfect addition to every science fiction reader's collection.\"\n\n\u2014Night Owl Romance\n\n\"Incredible, emotional and heartbreaking!

I was hooked from the first page. It's fast paced, funny, heartwarming, and will take all your feelings and rip them to shreds. Oh and there are aliens... All my favorite things!\"\n\n\u2014Mandy Hubbard, author of The Baba Yaga series\n\n\"This was a fun scifi romance that I never wanted to end. Funny, heartbreaking, adventurous, and utterly charming. Just what I wanted, I thought, but I knew the second I started I'd be looking forward to the next book. And I was right. I love this series.\"\n\n\u2014Lynn Larsh, author of The Vampire and the Virgin and Queen of the Undead\n\n\"There are two types of science fiction. One focuses on the science, the other\u2014sometimes\u2014focuses on the fiction. It's all in the execution. This isn't a science fiction novel, but rather a futuristic romance. However, there is a lot of science embedded within the plot along with some solid, credible science fiction content. I would encourage the reader to read the author's other books because it's well worth the effort. Ms. Altares' plot twists are very well executed, there is a good mix of humor, science fiction elements, and a romance that is sure to tug your heartstrings. I am looking forward to learning what happens next with her characters in her forthcoming novels. I received this book as a review copy and couldn't wait to read it. You will also enjoy it... Well written and edited. The author gave me great things to think about without making me feel silly about what is only a silly story. It's also very satisfying!\"\n\n\u2014The Romance Dish\n\n\"Well executed, well written and edited and fun to read. I couldn't wait to see what happened next with these characters.\"\n\n\u2014Coffee Time Romance and More\n\n\"Ad\u00e8le is a feisty heroine with her own unique way of thinking. When combined with a crew of intelligent and diverse characters I couldn't help but be entertained. This one was perfect for me and it can be read without having read the previous books in the series. However, I would highly recommend reading the preceding books on your own time, because I now want to know what happens to them all.\"\n\n\u2014A Reader's Retreat\n\n\"A highly original idea backed up by solid science, a charming heroine, and an enigmatic hero, this series is sure to appeal to fans of sci-fi, romance, space opera, and/or hard SF. The fact that the characters are so clearly delineated and that you get an almost instant grasp on their personality is one of the things that drew me in, as well as the fact that so far there's been very few clich\u00e9s involved. The world building is strong, too, and I very much enjoyed going along for the ride after meeting her characters in her previous books. This series is like nothing I've read before. It reminded me a bit of The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu, though it's not as good, at least not yet. I can't wait to return to it and hopefully the world gets a little more interesting with time to come. There was a lot\u2014and I mean a lot\u2014of plot here where we know that it all goes somewhere. Highly recommended.\"\n\n\u2014The Romance Dish\n\n## Contents\n\nChapter 1\n\nChapter 2\n\nChapter 3\n\nChapter 4\n\nChapter 5\n\nChapter 6\n\nChapter 7\n\nChapter 8\n\n",

So, if we've put this plan in place and it's just one school, why is that happening?\nEluned Morgan AM: And what did the inspectorate say\u2014?\nSuzy Davies AM: Oh, the inspectorate. We all know what inspectorate says.\nEluned Morgan AM: Actually, we don't\u2014I've made that clear. We don't know why the inspectorate did  what they did. We don't know what the circumstances were.\nDawn Bowden AM: Let me just ask the last one of the questions. The reason we don't know is because you've got the inspectorate, who have looked at what's happening, who are very clear.\nSuzy Davies AM: Well, I think we want to get to the bottom of that. I'm not saying that the inspectorate is wrong about this. The inspectorate is a trusted voice, and we do need to\u2014we need to respond to what they're saying, we do have to accept that inspectorate judgement, but the fact that you've said 'we don't know'\u2014\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, let them come before the committee then.\nSuzy Davies AM: Thank you, but let's get to the bottom\u2014and, of course, if you've got some concerns about the inspectorate, let's air them.\nEluned Morgan AM: Well, there's a process under way.\nSuzy Davies AM: All right. So, in terms of the issue that's brought the inspectorate to make the judgment that's gone against this school, then let's understand that and then let's make sure that we've got to the bottom of what has happened and what we can do to rectify it.\nEluned Morgan AM: So the inspectorate have reported\u2014?\n\nSuzy Davies AM: To you, that's the important bit here. We've got to get to the bottom of what they've thought and to make sure that we understand what has happened, or you'll just shrug your shoulders and say 'well, we don't know'. Well, you will know what the inspectorate has said.\nItem 6: private meeting of the Committee\n\nThe meeting in private of the Committee was closed to the public but open to the press and Members of the public present, in accordance with Standing Orders 17.44 to 17.51.\n\nQuestion\n\nSummarize Huw Morris's opinion of how to ensure that the money coming into the sector is being used in the best manner to provide services for our young people.\n\nAnswer\n\nHuw Morris agreed with Kirsty Williams' view that the money is being used in the best manner for our young people.\nLynne Neagle: Thank you very much.\n\nThe meeting of the Committee resumed in public.\n\nLynne Neagle: Thank you. Thank you very much, Members. Just to confirm the times by which we will need to have the paper out of this meeting, I think we will have the Chair's report by midnight. I think the Chair has a note of it. In relation to the Chair's report, we will have those in Members' hands this morning and we will have a paper in all Members' hands by midnight. We will get that done very thoroughly and swiftly by the staff here, so please give them a big thank-you. Item 7 then: we're now coming to the final item on the agenda, which is our scrutiny session on the Welsh language charter. I have a letter from Plaid Cymru, which was sent out via the Clerk to the Committee, which I did mention beforehand in the agenda. So, we have asked for evidence from Welsh Government on the progress of the policy development of the whole-language",
    "8": "\nWhen Vaughan Gething was a Minister in the health Department, he was concerned about the state of the perinatal mental health service \u2013 how effective is it really? Is it still meeting all the needs of the women who need it?\n\nWhere does a woman go to get support if her perinatal mental health needs are not being met?\n\nWhat happens when she's discharged from hospital with a crisis point that has been recognised, and her children are aged between birth and five years\u2014or is it actually six \u2013and her partner isn't able to deal with it?\n\nHow many women die during that time and their families are affected?\n\nAre we really making any progress in terms of reducing the stigma?\n\nWhat progress have we made in terms of actually improving the mental health of the families, the mothers and the unborn baby?\n\nWhy are there still suicides?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIt should be noted that all these questions are related.\nThe issue is the stigma and the embarrassment that is felt by many pregnant women and their families when they go to the perinatal mental health service during this particularly difficult time. Vaughan Gething would do whatever he could to keep this service in the top league, and to ensure that the women and their partner or carer can recover and get their lives back on track as soon as possible.\n\nThe Minister has failed to answer questions about mental health support for the pregnant women, their families and anyone who has been recently discharged and isn't feeling better.\n\nWhy are so many pregnant women and mothers and families not getting the support they need?\n\nThe Minister needs to assure the childcare and young people committee and the Welsh public that this service is functioning effectively.\n\nHas the Welsh Government done enough to train the family doctors in the perinatal mental health service in recognising pregnant women who need mental health support?\n\nWill Vaughan Gething say that he was doing everything he could in the Department of Health to keep this service in a strong place?\n\nWhy would the Minister not want parents to know about the crisis point of a pregnant woman needing support?\n\nCan the Minister answer Vaughan Gething now?\n\nIs Vaughan Gething now going to say that there's progress being made?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIf Vaughan Gething was a Minister in the health Department with the ability to do anything to support the mental health of mothers, he would not hesitate in doing that.\n\nIs Vaughan Gething actually now going to answer the question, then?\n\nThis may be a political question to ask the public.\n\nVaughan Gething can answer this question or he can let the question lie on the table.\n\nBut if he's a Minister today, then he will answer it.\nWill Vaughan Gething speak up for the pregnant mothers and women?\n\nAnswer:\n\nVaughan Gething wishes he was a Minister in the health Department to do more for pregnant mothers and their families. He does not have that power today \u2013 so what would he do as a Minister from a different Department?\n\nWhat would he do to reduce the numbers of suicides?\n\nAnswer:\n\nHe's seen too many pregnant women committing suicide in hospital while their baby is still in his mother's womb. If he was in charge of that hospital, he would not let that happen.\n\nHow many mothers and their families have died because Vaughan Gething and his colleagues in Westminster and Cardiff bay have refused to do enough?\n\nWho has to answer: Vaughan Gething or someone else?\n\nAnswer: Vaughan Gething.\n\nBut he's a Welsh Minister.\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Welsh Government doesn't have that kind of power either, but if Vaughan Gething was a Welsh Minister in charge of his Department in Westminster, he would certainly not have let that happen before.\n\nAnd now Vaughan Gething speaks up for the pregnant mothers.\n\nWhat does the Minister want to say?\n\nAnswer:\n\nVaughan Gething is actually a Minister in charge of the health Department. He wants to help the pregnant mothers and their families.\n\nWhere were the Welsh Government and the Welsh Government-funded NHS when Vaughan Gething should not have let mothers and families die because of the lack of support that pregnant mothers and their families should have been given?\n\nA pregnant woman is in hospital dying in front of her baby and her family. She needs mental help, and the Minister cannot say that he has the resources to do anything about that.\n\nThe Government is failing pregnant mothers and children.\n\nThat includes the mental health of young people from age five upwards.\n\nThis has been going on at least for one and a half years.\n\nWe don't know the progress",

And we had been talking about the plans for the rest of this semester, and I think the question is whether or not we want to try to build on what we have already, uh, and try to write two more papers with, uh, a subset of the group members. Um, but the only reason to do that is because I think that if we can get the rest of this stuff published in two months, it would be really beneficial. And, uh,\n\nGrad F: So it's going to be a quick turnaround.\n\nProfessor B: Quick turn a quick turnaround on writing papers and the {disfmarker} and the review process.\nGrad F: And the time to actually make the paper and publish it, uh?\n\nProfessor B: Nope. I think if we're gonna keep the paper short, it's fairly rapid. Um, we can talk about that. I think all I said was that if we can get the stuff done this semester, it would be really beneficial,\n\nGrad F: uh,\nProfessor B: I mean, basically we're not in a big hurry.\n\nGrad F: um, I think we're not {pause}\n\nProfessor B: Well, I think we're not in a huge hurry.\n\nGrad F: Oh, oh yeah?\n\nProfessor B: So, uh. So I think maybe we should be thinking a little bit more about what papers we want to write. Um. Yeah. I think for me it would just be nice to put together in the next two, three months some paper on the {disfmarker}\n\nGrad F: Uh, the stuff on Aurora.\n\nProfessor B: It would be good to have a paper on that.\n\nGrad F: Mm - hmm.\n\nProfessor B: I kind of put together the stuff I've just done for I think about a month and a half now and sort of put it out there. And now I think it needs some more work but, uh.\n\nGrad F: How long do you think it would take you to finish it?\n\nProfessor B: I don 't know.\n\nGrad F: You don 't know?\n\nProfessor B: I don 't know. I've been writing up a draft to give out, uh, to the {disfmarker} the reviewers I 'd say in about another week.\n\nGrad F: Hmm.\n\nProfessor B: And then I mean really you've just got to find reviewers. But uh.\n\nGrad F: Well, I 'll say that I have got some {disfmarker} i i\n\nProfessor B: Okay.\n\nGrad F: Some {disfmarker} I had the thought of maybe including some of this work on this stuff to do with VTS in the Aurora paper. So when it's ready I could maybe ask for an abstract of a paper to be included if it's an appropriate type of paper.\n\nProfessor B: Mhm.\n\nGrad F: And then after that comes out then we could do the actual paper.\n\nProfessor B: Which would take maybe {disfmarker} two weeks\n\nGrad F: Yes.\n\nProfessor B: Two weeks to write the main paper and then two weeks for it to be reviewed.\n\nGrad F: Yeah.\n\nProfessor B: Um. Um. And then if we had to work on a revision of this paper, or something, I would imagine that would take maybe another week.\n\nGrad F: Right.\n\nProfessor B: But two a week to get the papers done, you could even speed up a.\n\nGrad F: Yeah.\nProfessor B: You could even speed them up.\n\nGrad F: Or slow them up. Of course.\n\nProfessor B: Depending on what else you're doing. Mm - hmm.\n\nGrad F: Yes. So.\n\nProfessor B: So then that would get us done by maybe in the first week of January.\n\nGrad F: Yeah.\n\nProfessor B: So.\n\nGrad F: And then the review process might take a week.\n\nProfessor B: Mm. That's about right.\n\nGrad F: Um, yeah. Any ideas for anyone else?\n\nPhD B: I don 't think I'm gonna contribute any more on Aurora, if you guys want to\n\nGrad F: You wouldn 't mind\nPhD B:.\nThe rest of the group agreed.\n\nGrad F: Okay. so",

    "12": "\nWales has had, I suppose, a slightly different history of education than most countries in the UK, so there were many changes of policy towards education. I remember clearly my own experience after I left school, that it used to be school education everywhere, and then there was a great outcry, because it wasn't school education everywhere, and then there was a real big push to increase provision for everyone to get as much education as they possibly could, so the further education colleges and the polytechnics were built largely in Wales. The university went through a very long time of being a relatively small part of the overall system, and now it's a significant part. And you can argue that in Wales we were perhaps more concerned about equality than other places, so there was a much bigger push to look after everyone's education and to ensure that we got a universal education system. And, of course, those changes in education are really good things on the whole. So, there's no doubt that they happened for the best reasons and I don't think that's something that we should be against. No plan, whatever it might be, will be perfect or all-inclusive, and so on and so on. There's always going to be change and there's always going to be some level of change that's uncomfortable or even\u2014[Interruption.] I don't want to say unintended outcomes, but\u2014and we have to always bear that in mind in how we think about education in Wales. And that's why our focus at the moment has been on the content of the Bill and, more particularly, on what it is we're all doing about education in Wales, and what we're going to do about the challenges we all face, in our own contexts. I've been a school teacher, I'm the Chair of a school, I've been a head teacher; I've been a university teacher; I've been involved in FE and in education more generally, so I'm a pretty broad church where education's concerned, so to say. That's probably not a phrase people are used to from me, but it's very sincere! But we have to keep challenging ourselves\u2014I think there's a danger for me to challenge myself\u2014and always try to ask where we're going and where we're going and where we should be going rather than asking why it was that we weren't going there already. But, no plan is definitive, because we just don't know what's going to happen; we just don't know. But my worry is the change of education in Wales in particular has too much focus on quantity as opposed to quality. I don't want to say we need to reduce the quantity\u2014if I'm right, you're going to ask me what I think about quantity. I think that's a distraction from where we should be focusing now, which is, is this right or not? Should we keep it as it is, should we reduce the quantity, should we increase it, whatever that plan for education might be. I don't wish to go down this line of saying the quality is worse now than it was before, because I think the changes, the historical changes to education in Wales have been for the right reasons, and I respect the people who brought them about, and it's a shame that the political will has shifted in such a way that they are not being applied at the moment in Wales. No plan is definitive, but I worry we might be going down a particular track in Wales, because we have to always be challenging ourselves, we have to always keep asking ourselves and always keep wondering what ought to be here rather than where it's not there or, where we don't have there, we need more, we do need more and so on. And that's not to say it's all one thing\u2014whatever it all is [Laughter], not all about FE, not all about universities, not all about education per se. It's going to be different for everything and that's not a criticism, but it's just something to bear in mind. And, I don't want to pick a fight with anyone, but the focus should really be on quality as well. And I would say, the more we're focused on quantity, the less we're focused on quality, the less we will be focusing on what we are all supposed to be delivering for students, which is quality education and an equal chance in Wales for all students.\nQuery:\n\nDid he agree with Lynne Neagle?\n\nAnswer:\n\nI think Lynne is actually very much a supporter, I think, of the role of FE in higher and further education in Wales. I've no doubt that. I would say they've talked a lot of crap about FE in Wales, but I don't think they want it to go away altogether. So, I think we've all said it for entirely understandable reasons around quantity.",
    "13": "Dr Blaney: Well, the first thing to say is we don't know the answer to that question. Our role is to oversee universities. It's a risk management role. So, what we are doing is asking them to ask the questions and it's always the right questions. We get the right answer because we are asking the right question, and the right question, as we've said, is, 'What are you doing? Why are you doing it? How much do you know? And why is it worth doing, if it's not worth doing?' If they don't ask the right questions, and their decisions are not the right decisions, then that suggests a governance failure, clearly. I don't think there's any doubt that they've asked the right questions; the governing bodies' role is to challenge the executive, and we think they are asking the right sorts of questions. But the reason we get the right answers is because we're asking the right questions, and we're very clear with our universities of our expectations.\n\nQuery:\n\nHave you any concerns that the executive teams are falling short in responding to those sorts of questions?\n\nDr Blaney: I think, with respect, it's maybe one of those things that's a little bit more difficult to be objective on. So, there is a sense of a crisis; there is stress in universities at the moment. And so, for example, we were not unaware of students who had been through traumas, some of those coming in recent years, and that was not a part of our remit\u2014that was entirely their concern, because of the confidentiality of the data. And although we might not be comfortable with what was going on, it was not a role for us to go out and find out what was going on in terms of the culture and how people were being looked after. And it wasn't our priority.\n\nQuery:\n\nThe same with the working environment culture. If that is the case, is that something for you to intervene on? Or\u2014\nDr Blaney: Well, no, that's not our job either, if you don't mind. I suppose if the universities are looking to us for clarity on policy, that's maybe something, but that's more of an executive oversight role as well. But with respect to them asking the right questions of how they're looking after their staff and their capacity to look after their staff, it's very clear that they're doing that. If they weren't, they wouldn't keep asking us those questions.\n\nQuery:\n\nThis is a completely fair question. I think we were talking about governance in terms of challenging the executive. You were there at the start. Is there anything that strikes you as being odd and unusual?\n\nDr Blaney: No, I think it's\u2014just very occasionally, you see things that you're not sure of. That I think what I'd say is very occasionally we see things where\u2014and actually, we didn't see it ourselves until we read the minutes. So, we didn't see it ourselves and even then, we saw it through an analysis of the minutes. So, it takes quite a bit for us, perhaps, to have a concern or a worry about these things, and there's nothing right at this moment.\n\nQuery:\n\nAnd when we do think these things through, you intervene to ensure that the correct arrangements are in place?\n\nDr Blaney: Yes, and we are, as I said earlier, we have a range of ways to do that. And we always stress the importance of working together in this. So, for example, if we had been\u2014\nLynne Neagle AM: You've indicated that you are concerned about Trinity Saint David. Can you give an example of where or when you have become concerned? Do I have to ask this question for every university in Wales?\n\nDr Blaney: I really don't see that we're in any position to talk about individual institutions.\n\nQuery:\n\nOkay. But if one university is at risk, then aren't you concerned that that affects everyone else as well?\n\nDr Blaney: That's true.\nLynne Neagle AM: Yes, but what we've actually talked about in private is what to do if one university is at risk. There's no point in going through what we've just talked about in private\u2014what to do if one university might come under further risk\u2014when nothing's at risk, and one institution is in fact in much better health than the rest.\n\nDr Blaney: Well, you've got our answer.\n\nLynne Neagle AM: There's no point in asking questions if you don't ask us questions that we feel able to answer. Well, there is a point in asking questions. It's what we tell them to do when",

    "15": "\nQuestion:\nWhat are the target price, target cost and target profit of remote control when discussing the design of the remote control?\n\nExplanation and Solution:\n\n\"The target price, target cost and target profit of the remote control will be\n\n- target price: 25 euro\n\n- target cost: 15 euro\n\n- target profit: 50 million euro\n\nWhy do they all have to be in monetary notation?\n\nAnswer\n\nAnswer:\nQuestion:\n\nWhy do they all have to be in monetary notation?\n\nExplanation and Solution\n\nQuestion:\n\nQuestion:\n\nYou guys must be smart. What are the target price, target cost and target profit of what remote control? Is it target price of 25 euro, target cost of 15 euro and target profit of 50 million Euros? You can round the figures, just don't use non-monetary forms of notation in front of the numbers (i.e. do not use i.e. instead of in other words as a form of punctuation. You can use phrases instead to make your answer easier to understand)\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn the last question, they talked about remotes that you can't turn on and off with one button, so maybe you can make some kind of button that does nothing, maybe a button that lights up if you push it and then if it's clicked, you get a menu? They say the train looks good but it doesn't even move, so maybe the button can move the train and the button could be on the train? You can round, but please don't spell out everything. Remember, don't use words such as however, like (even though), therefore, etc. Use phrases and words in your answers.\n\nIf you feel that you need more time to answer this question, do not make unnecessary noise when making noise. It's really not helping you when you make noise during the exam. So if a question is taking you too long to answer, you don't have to rush to make noise and move to the next question. There is a good chance that someone can help you when you get stuck.\n\nIt's really bad for you if you use words such as however, like. These words have to be replaced with phrases such as it's better to say I think because you're sure to use words like however, therefore, like in every test question of this kind. You need to have better control of your English.\n\nIf a question is easy you can finish it and then move on to the next question. It's not good for you during the exam to do that, but you can do it.\n\nYou may come across questions like the one above during the exam. Try to use phrases to answer them as it will be an easier way to show that you know how to answer them. Don't say it's like but say I think instead.\n\nYou guys are really good at reading books, so I think you'll do fine with this one.\n\nTry to put the numbers in the question in proper sentences so they make sense. Remember, you need to get a certain type of answer. For instance, your answer should NOT read like this:\n\n\"the train looks good but it does not move\".\n\nInstead make the sentences look like this:\n\n\"the train has pretty pictures and it is good for doing some research.\"\n\nFor more detailed practice on exam technique, there is a link further down which will help you.\n\nIt's important to answer these kinds of questions as it is a form of a trick question. It is not good to use phrases such as I think, therefore, I believe, etc. Think carefully when answering the first question (you have a whole year to do that).\n\nThe second question is straight forward and you can make clear sentences and phrases. The same for the last one.\n\nRead the question carefully so you know which numbers you need to spell out in words. For instance, if you need to read the number thirty-five as thirty-five euro then spell it that way.\n\nYou guys are really good at punctuation. You don't use i.e. as a means of punctuation, but you are still good. Please have a look at the other practice questions after the key, and watch out for the same mistake.\n\nThe second question here is easy and you can read it as \"the train doesn't actually move but it has nice pictures.\" You guys are good to get the details right when punctuating.\n\nIt's really important to do this type of question correctly, so make sure to use proper numbers and punctuation. Don't use i.e. or any other non-monetary terms in front of the figures if not specified by the question. It wouldn't look good if",

And then obviously if people wanted a lapel and uh you know if you are in the same room with them I would think that you 'd have to give it to them\n\nAndreas: Yes\n\nPostdoc G: But if you're in another room you could have a hand - held.\n\nAndreas: Yes.\n\nPostdoc G:\n\nAndreas: Or in any case all our mikes that we have here are uh they're available in a way that\n\nPostdoc G: I mean I think this is like the same with any kind of equipment that you get from vendors.

Well,\n\nAndreas: The fact is they wouldn't have to choose the first thing. They could actually just choose something and when they got to be\n\nPostdoc G: So what I\n\nAndreas: Or then if it was some microphone that everyone hated they could choose to get one of\n\nPostdoc G: And how you go about getting things like that is like you get the microphone you get the mike you get it through a purchasing order and they mail you the mike and all the cabling and you get it together and you could be all set.\n\nAndreas: Yep\n\nPostdoc G: I was talking as a metaphor for like uh say for the workshop stuff. So like if you know if something's broken we can replace the microphone it, it's already happening.\n\nProfessor B: Yes, right.\n\nPostdoc G: and I think that's exactly it\n\nGrad E: Maybe you should just have the other people help you with the wiring, I guess that's the hardest part\n\nAndreas: I have no problems with that\n\nPostdoc G: Or you could have somebody doing the wiring\n\nAndreas: For me..\n\nPostdoc G: Well it's very difficult and it's not just doing\n\nAndreas: I have\n\nPostdoc G: What?\n\nAndreas: And they could have it all wired up\n\nProfessor B: We'll have a\n\nPostdoc G: I don '",
    "17": "The Hon. the Prime Minister (Mr. Justin Trudeau): I'd like to thank the Prime Minister for being with us today. Mr. Chair: You can use a minute.\n\nRight Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister, Lib.): Mr. Chair, students have been let down by the Canadian government. Young people don't just want to earn money; they also want to gain work experience. That's why we're setting up programs, including Canada summer jobs, but also another program with 76,000new jobs for young people in important sectors, so that young people can also get jobs. We will continue to work with youth and employers to ensure that gaps in the labour market are addressed, while ensuring that youth are well-supported.\n\nQuery:\n\nWhat is the status of the Canada emergency student benefit?\n\nHon. the Deputy Prime Minister (Chrystia Freeland): The minister is right, and she knows it. Mr. Chair: You have a minute or two.\n\nHon. the Deputy Prime Minister (Chrystia Freeland): The government is trying to make sure that every Canadian in Canada who needs help gets it, and that's exactly what we're doing for students.\n\nHon. the Deputy Prime Minister (Chrystia Freeland): Young people need money, but they also need work experience. This is an unprecedented situation, which is why we're working with tourism industries and the different regions to make sure they have a sufficient workforce in their situation. Students can be part of it, but at the same time we must provide the necessary support for those who can't find a job. That's why we continue to work with the industries involved to ensure that they have a sufficient workforce while we support students.\n\nHon. the Deputy Prime Minister (Chrystia Freeland): That's very interesting, but it doesn't answer my question at all. People in the fishing, tourism and agricultural sectors, as well as municipalities and, from the very beginning, of course, the Government of Quebec, more generally, have expressed fears that job gains will cause people to lose their benefits and discourage them from going to work. The only way to avoid that is to ensure that people keep more money in their pockets as they work more. I think we can have a clear answer, given the timeframe. People are going to start registering for the program on Friday. The principles are good, but a clear answer would be good too.\n\nHon. the Deputy Prime Minister (Chrystia Freeland): Beginning Friday, students will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit. When they apply, they'll all be directed to a job bank that we've set up to make sure they know what jobs are available to get not only the money they need, but also the experience they need for their future, while helping our society in this crisis. I know we're going to be able to count on young people.\n\nHon. the Deputy Prime Minister (Chrystia Freeland): Of course, Mr. Chair. I want to thank the member for understanding the importance of supporting students who, for the most part, won't be able to get the summer jobs they were counting on. The student jobs are still there. Young people don't just want to earn money; they also want to gain work experience. That's why we're setting up programs, including Canada summer jobs, but also another program with 76,000new jobs for young people in important sectors. We'll continue to work with youth and employers to ensure that gaps in the labour market are addressed, while ensuring that youth are well-supported.\n\nQuestion:\n\nWhat is the total cost for the Canada emergency student benefit?\n\nHon. the Deputy Prime Minister (Chrystia Freeland): Mr. Chair, I thank the hon. member for his question. This is an unprecedented situation, which is why we're working as fast as we can to help those millions of Canadians who need support. We are working very hard to fill gaps for people who should get money but haven't been able to, and as I said, we have strong measures to counter fraud. Anyone who got this money fraudulently will have to repay it.\n\nRespected colleague:\n\nWhat did the Prime Minister say about the future?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIn response to an answer to a question\n\nRespected colleague:\n\nWhat did the Prime Minister say about the future?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe Right Hon. the Prime Minister (Mr. Justin Trudeau): Mr. Chair, we need to look ahead. We need to work on fixing things that are working. This is the opportunity we have today. I'll turn to the other side of the ledger. We have a very important file to consider: the bill on protecting our environment. Justine and I would like to set an example",
