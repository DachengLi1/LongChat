    "1": "Buffy left Giles, Xander and Anya the night before and got into the Initiative. She met up with Angleman who said that Riley was okay, but that he would be better elsewhere, elsewhere meaning the Initiative. She went down into the sewers, got some answers, and saw a bit of Adam. She wants the Initiative to have Adam because she's not at all sure that Adam is okay. She wants the Initiative to be okay, but isn't sure why and so she wants them to have Adam. Angleman is still not back yet and Spike, the vampire, is alone in the Initiative, recovering in the medical unit. Riley gets the bad news from Forrest and Buffy is unable to get to him. After a moment of contemplation and staring at the wall she closes her eyes.\nBuffy: (softly) I know. I'll find a way and you guys get Riley. Xander leaves his side and Willow goes to a closed door. She puts a keycard into the lock and the door opens. She walks inside and Riley doesn't stir. She stands there listening with the sounds of TV on, talking about Buffy and Riley and what happened on the monitors. She walks across the room to look out over the hills. We go to Giles and Anya. They're in the Initiative lab. The lab is dark and there are some bottles on some counter spaces. Next to them is a computer keyboard and a video screen. There is a table with some test tubes and a beaker. Anya's looking concerned. Anya: What could have happened to make Professor Walsh want to kill you? Buffy: (at a loss) I don't know, uh. She looks around a bit then starts to pace. Anya: She's getting too close to something. That's for sure. Maggie sent me on a one way recon. She's an unnecessary risk. She wants me to stay away from the Initiative. I can tell there's something Maggie hides, some secret.\nAnya: Two of our hostiles broke free and escaped into the tunnels. Professor Walsh is dead. Will he tell you what's going on?\nAnya: A slayer can only fight so much.\nAnya: This is our enemy's objective. Maggie is working toward the destruction of the world. If that gets in the hands of someone like the Mayor or the council it could be very bad.\nXander: We have to stop Maggie before that happens. It'll be too late.\nAnya: We have to take her down and stop her before she can achieve her apocalypse.\nGiles: How will you do that?\nAnya: Maggie must be stopped before she can destroy the world.\nGiles: Or at least make sure that if she does destroy the world that she destroys the world of Sunnydale.\nXander: (thinking) What do you think about our going in undercover as Initiative recruits?\nAnya: I'll research the Initiative and how I can join it.\nGiles: Will you do that while Riley's being held prisoner?\nXander: Of course, but I'll be close. We'll find a way to escape. When Maggie's out of the way, we will need allies if we're going to keep the Initiative from becoming what it really is. A place where good doesn't triumph but must be forced.\nAnya: And if anybody's going in undercover, I don't think it should be Xander.\nGiles: So you want Buffy.\nAnya: She's the smartest of us. If she could just hide her heart...\nGiles: It seems our only real option right now.\nAnya: I'll use my magic to hide Buffy's scent from Adam...\nGiles: And when we're ready we'll give her my word that we'll help her.\nXander: (to Anya's back) Okay. Let's get back to research.\nAnya: Riley will need us. Okay.\nXander: Okay. (sighs) It's better than leaving her alone. Willow: (as they leave) You guys get Riley and we'll make sure that the Initiative folks never find out about the Initiative. (sigh) Okay. (as they leave) Okay, yeah. (as she leans in to pull the drapes closed) You get Riley. (glances at Giles then backs away) You do get Riley.\nGiles: Okay. She closes the door. Buffy opens her eyes.\nBuffy: (resigned) Look I'm still not sure that it's a done deal. But I have to get to Riley. I need to get to him.\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nBTVS for whatever reason, to enjoy",

She shakes her head: \"What?\"\nAngel: \"Drink this. It'll help you sleep.\" Cordy looks at the cup, then at Angel. Angel: \"Cordy it might be the first time...\" Cordy lets out a sigh and takes a sip. Angel: \"That's right, it is. You're pregnant.\"\nCordy: \"Darla's gonna need some vampire blood if she's going to heal, and Darla is really, really hungry.\" Angel comes over to the bed and sits down beside her.\nAngel: \"I know it was Darla's idea to tell you herself, but - can't we put some good in front of her and let her know that it's going to be alright?\"\nCordy: \"We want it the other way around, but you can't say things like that to a vampire without expecting to have to make sure they believe you.\" Cordy takes another swallow of the vamp's blood. Cordy: \"I've been around her a long time, you know, and one thing I know is that good things happen fast and bad things happen slow. (Turns to Angel) I know that you put me in this position. I'm just saying that I'll work it that way. But it's still my choice, Angel. That's good news, right?\" Angel: \"Whatever happens. Good or bad.\" Cordy looks at him: \"Don't say that.\" Angel: \"You're right. Cordy darling.\" Cordy walks down the steps and into the lobby where Wes and Gunn are standing on the other side of the reception counter.\nCordy: \"The child has a soul.\"\nWes: \"That means something, doesn't it?\"\nGunn: \"Maybe it means that it doesn't have an evil soul.\"\nCordy: \"Or it means it's already the Tro-clan.\"\nGunn: \"Or it means that it's not here yet.\"\nWes: \"It sure feels like something else is out there.\" Cordy is sitting at the back of Lorne's office listening to the faint sounds of Darla snoring on the bed in the bedroom at the back of the club. She glances at the big, wide bed as she and Angel walk over to the office.\nWes: \"Well, the good news is that your calculations are way off. The actual day of the prophecy has not come.\"\nAngel: \"What?\" Gunn is standing at the door to Lorne's office.\nAngel: \"We don't know the exact day that the prophecy is going to come true. We only know that the prophecy says that this 'Tro-clan' or 'Tro-' something will be here.\" Cordy: \"But the problem is, Angel, even if she was born...\" Angel: \"What's the point, Cordy?\" Cordy: \"We know it's coming.\" Wes: \"Maybe, but not today.\" Gunn goes into Lorne's office, but Angel stays outside. Wes: \"It does feel like it's coming.\"\nCordy: \"I know. - I think Darla's going to want to go out soon, and to do that she's going to need blood.\"\nGunn: \"Okay. Let's not give her any, but - you don't have to sleep here.\" Angel: \"Alright, Cordy.

Wes said he'd be checking on Darla. You wanna have the big boss tell you when he's checking on the person who gave him the child he didn't have for a very very very long time.

[laughter] And it's also the saddest. Because Dwight is always so funny, he has never really been sad...\n\nJim: Oh, because now he feels bad because he told Michael to jump off the roof?\n\nKevin: That is a little sad.\nMichael: Dwight, come on! Don't be soft. It's not the first time you've said jump over here. You don't get to be the hero just every other day. You jump off this roof, Dwight!\n\nDwight: [sighing] Okay, I can't resist now.\nMichael: [exited] Great! He wants to do it!\nDwight: I don't know, I'm feeling all wimpy now, from doing a test.

I wanna do it... the job you get is never as good as the one you got the day before... No, no, no, no, listen to Toby. He knows something about psychology!\n\nToby: How it's an addiction? It's not that bad. There's something that helps with that, it's called Paxil.\nKaren: If you're not talking about drugs and stuff, how is Paxil helping?\nToby: I'm not saying it's just a placebo. This is a whole new branch of antidepressants. People say that it helps with addiction, but it's also a little known antidepressant.\n\nKevin: What, drugs for drugs?\nDwight: I mean, if you take it for longer than four days, it could have a bad effect. You should talk to a doctor.\n\nKevin: How long do you need to take it for?\nToby: I have to take it for longer than four days.\nKaren: Ooooh!\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nRyan: So, let's say that Darryl finds someone on the roof, right, and they're about to jump.

I don't think we've got one.\n\n[SCENE_BREAK]\nLIGHT: Well, there's only one thing to do. We've got lots of fish stock, so let's go to Tandorra Town.

If it's a woman, I'll smash in her face. Now, this is me rules.\n[A hand reaches out and lightly smashes the glass of the display case to the table. Frasier grabs it, but Phil catches it.]\n\nPhil: Now, see there are some things even a guy can't teach himself and I'm gettin' pretty sick of you two. So if you think it's going to be easy, I'll see you tomorrow.\n[He grabs him and throws him to the floor.

Then Phoebe talks about her boyfriend, Jason. She talks about how she wishes that she did not have to lie to him anymore and that she wanted them to be honest with each other so that would make things better. But Paige interrupts by asking if Jason is in love with her or if Jason loves him and that Jason kisses Phoebe and then Jason hugs him and then they are interrupted by Leo. They all think she doesn't love him anymore.\n\n2. They go and look for the king of the swarm demons because Phoebe believes that her boyfriend Jason is in love with her and wishes that she could talk to him. While they are looking for the king, they see a lot of swarm demons. When the three Charmed Ones are about to get attacked, Phoebe says the words of power and makes a spell, which makes the fireballs come out of the demons. Then, when they are in trouble, Piper and Paige help Phoebe, but Phoebe doesn't want that help because she thinks that it is unfair to Jason and that Jason is the one who made bad decisions and he is trying to protect himself from her secrets. But Jason tries to convince her to tell him everything. Then, when she finds Jason's limo, she says she doesn't know what she is going to tell him and Jason doesn't know what they're going to do about it and then they kiss and then Phoebe takes the potion and Jason thinks that Phoebe is trying to turn on him.\n\n3. They take the king with them to the manor and Phoebe gets the potion in a coat pocket that Jason takes out and he thinks that Phoebe is trying to harm him and then Phoebe tries to tell him that she's sorry that she is using everything to be with him so Jason hugs her. Jason tells Phoebe his secret about wanting to protect his company and how Jason doesn't have anyone that he can trust right now, and then they talk about Phoebe not trusting Jason and then Phoebe thinks that Jason is trying to make him take the fall for this and then the king gets away from Jason and then Jason realizes that he has a different man's potion in his pocket and then Phoebe tells Jason that she has made a lot of mistakes but that Jason isn't the one that made those mistakes and then Piper and Paige think they can hear the swarm demons. Then, when they go and meet the king, Phoebe stops one of them from following her and she says that Jason is trying to protect himself from her secrets. Then Jason and Phoebe have a discussion about why it isn't fair for Leo to see her, because she thinks she is better than him, she thinks that they don't get enough time together because they are always on the run from enemies and their problems, but Phoebe also blames it on Jason and how he has been dragging her around the world to protect his business and how Jason doesn't have anyone to trust anymore, he has the only time that he can find for him and her, Jason loves her that much. But Jason tells Phoebe that he thinks he has been using her to move along in his career and she says they need some time to get away from their problems, as Jason tries to think about how it isn't fair for Leo to see her.\n\n4. They take Jason to the manor and Leo sees Jason, Piper thinks that he looks tired, which makes Paige think that Phoebe is having problems with Jason, but Leo says that he doesn't care about Jason's past with her. Then they take Jason to his room and Phoebe is surprised to see a cot, she didn't think that Leo would have so much stuff, but she also thinks it takes time to build a relationship, then Leo sees Phoebe she hugs her and Phoebe says she is trying to get revenge and then Phoebe says that she loves Jason and Jason thinks that he saved Jason from the king of the swarm demons and then Leo goes to his room because he has to check on Wyatt. Then Phoebe thinks that Jason still wants his privacy, Phoebe has some wine, she has some trouble with her phone again, Phoebe says that Jason still wants to go to the party, Phoebe says she hates France, then Paige comes in and asks Phoebe why is she running back to Jason.

They give her a file on her mother. There's a letter from the school nurse. They give her a file on her father. They give Spencer some e-mail messages to be read. We read two.\n\n[Wilden's office]\n\nWilden: You were absent the better part of yesterday, so let's just cut to the chase, shall we? You were found with this girl outside the area of your residence and your parents say you came home the day the girl, Miss Sorenson, was reported missing. That's bullshit. You told me you didn't meet her outside of school until last night. It's an hour and fifty-seven minute walk. Do you have an alibi?\nSpencer: I'll tell you when I'm done.\nWilden: That's what I'm afraid of.\nSpencer: I did not kill Alison or Melissa. There's no way, I did not do it.\nWilden: Okay. So, you have an alibi. Your parents also say you're taking prescription medication for anxiety, depression, and headaches. Again, bullshit.\nSpencer: Is this a trick question? They are my prescription medication... for, ah, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. But I'm going to be sixteen so they can't make me take them anymore.\nWilden: Okay. So, you don't have a medical condition that would explain your absences. Or an excuse for being so far from home.\nSpencer: I didn't want to go home.\nWilden: So, you were outside of your apartment. At night. Alone. What were you doing?\nSpencer: Trying to get out of my own head.\nWilden: Your friends had a lot to say about where you were. And now you're claiming you were trying to avoid school.\nSpencer: Is this really what this is about? This is a lot of questions about me going back and forth in my mind. As if that's something to get in trouble over.\nWilden: You're being selfish. Do you want us to get it through your head that you're under suspicion for murder? If you were worried... about your friends here you can always ask them to come in privately. Or better yet, you're obviously troubled. Maybe you should take some time off to see a therapist, just like your mother.\n[Spencer's room at home]\nEmily: Hi.\nSpencer: What... what do you want?\nEmily: I wanted to talk to you about this before we go see your family about it. Yeah, I was really late tonight, and I didn't even bring a backpack. I wasn't sure you'd be awake. What do you have to say for yourself?\nSpencer: Um...\nEmily: Oh, yeah? What's that?\nSpencer: You have to know that I did not kill Alison. It's ridiculous.\nEmily: Really? You weren't mad at me for standing up to the cops?\nSpencer: I was mad. I was mad at you.\nEmily: Why didn't you tell me she was calling you? I was pretty freaked out by that part in the woods, and if I'd known who I was dealing with, I think I may have done worse to you.\nSpencer: It's over.\nEmily: Oh yeah. You want to do it like before?\nSpencer: I don't know.\nEmily: Look, please don't be mad at me. I didn't think there was any way this would end well for anybody. This situation is not my fault. You, I can't even talk about. As for me, when I saw the message on your face, that was enough to know I needed to cut this thing off before it gets any worse than it already has. But I still feel like for you, this is just harder, and I don't know if you're gonna get better.\nSpencer: I told you. You were enough for me.\nEmily: Are you sure about that? So you've met Ben.\nSpencer: Yes.\nEmily: Why, why Ben?\nSpencer: Because Ben's great.\nEmily: Yes, he is. I mean, I feel like I'm just a big fat jerk for comparing you to him.\nSpencer: What do you mean, how you feel?\nEmily: I'm just worried that",

She reaches to Buffy's window, Buffy's closed bedroom door behind her. Buffy looks at Dawn. We hear Buffy sobbing, we see Dawn staring down at her, then Buffy standing up, reaching a hand out to Dawn. We hear Buffy's sobs as Dawn stares down at her, then Buffy reaches out to Dawn. We catch a single tear on Dawn's cheek, but her smile breaks in. Dawn's smile is gone completely. Buffy's tears are still coming. Dawn reaches out to her. She and Buffy look into each other's eyes, Buffy crying into her shoulder. Dawn returns Buffy's embrace as Buffy sits up on her bed again, facing the door. Buffy looks past the door to the window. Dawn stands next to her, they look as one into the street beyond. Buffy begins to cry again. Dawn takes Buffy's face and wipes her tears with her fingers, takes her face in both hands and kisses her. Buffy's tears stop. Dawn sits on the floor beside Buffy and holds both her hands in both of hers as she strokes Buffy's cheek, then returns Buffy's embrace. Buffy leans back against Daisy, her father's gun beside her, watching her friends walk down the street together. Buffy and Dawn sit outside the door of someone else's home in the dark, watching one another, smiling. Dawn and Buffy stand together at a bus stop, alone in the dark inside someone else's house. Buffy looks out the window of someone else's home and her friends are waiting in the park. Buffy looks out the window of her house in the dark, it is snowing. Dawn stands behind Buffy's chair. Everyone is waiting. Buffy and Dawn sit beside a tree together in the dark. Buffy looks out her bedroom window. Dawn stands behind Buffy. Buffy holds a picture of one of her friends. Dawn holds a picture of Buffy. But she holds it with a smile. They turn around toward someone else's door. Someone else's house. Someone else's home. They don't share the name of that home. But they hold it together. Buffy and Dawn stand in the darkness of someone else's bedroom, looking into one another's eyes. But they hold it together. Buffy and Dawn sit in one another's living rooms in the dark, holding the name of their home together. Buffy and Dawn walk down the road together. Each has brought someone. But they hold it together.

    "13": "\nThis is a strong episode and probably one of the strongest in Torchwood's first series. It has all the ingredients of a great episode of the series - plot, science fiction, action, emotions. The plot, whilst not wholly original, is quite clever, the first of a trio of very effective two parters.\n\nIt starts out on Platform One, in a futuristic version of the Doctor's ship, the TARDIS - a space station where people gather to watch the planet burn. To be on the Platform, you must pay a fee. As the first scene concludes, Rose walks in, is introduced to the Doctor, introduces him to Jabe, a humanoid tree (if you think that sounds unbelievable, wait until you see him!).\n\nIt is through Jabber and also later in conversation with Cassandra O'Brien, that this episode's most notable character appears - Rose's Mum. That character comes with a couple of shocks. First, Rose recognizes her Mum, who hasn't changed in the year between the episode now and the last. So, where has she been living, exactly? The other shock is that she does not know if she is her mum's birth-daughter or not.\n\nThis episode starts out full of fun, frivolity and light-heartedness with the Doctor and Rose, and then gets more emotional and more poignant as the planet burns above.\n\nFor a Time Lord, or anyone watching the series, to be without his people and to be alone forever is obviously the ultimate tragedy and, from the start, this episode seems to be suggesting exactly that and in great depth. This makes the Doctor's eventual meeting - more so now than ever before - with Rose, even more significant.\n\nEven without a mention of the 'Sonic Screwdriver' or his companion's name, this episode is notable for being one of the few that establishes the Doctor's personality. This is the first episode that gets inside the character, making the viewer understand the Doctor's nature.\n\nThe first Doctor story (The War Games) suggested a very kind and friendly but slightly irritable character, whereas this episode, being the third, shows him as a cold, bitter and lonely man. At other times in the series, his cynicism and sniping at Rose, are portrayed as a joke, but now we are shown him in a totally different light. This is the character who spends much of his life alone, not even knowing the names of his people.\n\nThis is also the first time we are shown him in a negative light and still he is a good man, at heart, with the best intentions.\n\nThe first few bits of dialogue are probably the funniest lines he has ever said. He is seen wearing a suit that is at least 4 thousand years old, and which he claims came just before he left in a box.\n\nWhen he takes Rose for a drive, he is seen doing the most ridiculous thing - revving up his sonic screwdriver before revolving and going backwards in time. He even manages to make the most boring subject on Earth, time travel, sound almost witty. He is also seen taking another person's phone and taking it off the hook, without being asked.\n\nAnd when the computer announcer asks her for a repeat of the last item, Rose says that she will \"give them one on One\". But, when the computer asks for \"the whole thing\" she is left saying \"the whole thing\" for an impossible amount of time and finally gets herself out of the program by saying something like \"The whole thing\". All this and this is still the same man who is later caught in a trap by Rose.\n\nThis episode seems to establish exactly what makes an episode of this series work well - it has to be exciting, emotional and above all, witty. Of all the Torchwood episodes, this is probably the most important.\n\nThis episode shows that a good Doctor story is worth saving the planet or two for and, while it may lose a bit of its luster compared to Torchwood II, it remains, in my opinion, the best and most moving story of the first series.\n\n(Terry Nation)\n\nWatershed:\n\nTerry Nation's most celebrated series Doctor Who is also the one he worked on least. This is hardly surprising, when you consider the fact that the series (or at least that which Terry could be credited with, as writer on) lasted almost thirty years, making The Trial of a Time Lord, a story he wrote fifteen years ago, more relevant than any of his other work.\n\nIt's hardly surprising then, that by the time he tried writing a novel based on his series for Doctor Who's second incarnation, Terry was feeling his age and had decided not to try to do the",

There is still food in it. [Jim and Gabe fall over again] You can save your friend the bear, and you can even share it with your wife and kids. [Jim and Gabe fall over again] The only downside to this scenario, is your kids aren't hungry, so why would you care? [Gabe and Jim fall over again] You take the soda, you have a picnic.

    "17": "\nThe C.I.A. and SD-6 must work together to stop Luc Jacqnoud, the master terrorist, from unleashing an unthinkable weapon of mass destruction. But who's really behind what's happening? Is it SD-6? Is it the C.I.A.? The truth is that it's Sydney. She's the only one who can stop Jacqnoud.\n\nEaster Egg:\n\nDid you miss something? Or maybe you just want to see it again. This is an easter egg that was included in the pilot script for Alias. It's a list of the major players and what they look like before being manipulated. For instance, did you know that in the beginning of the pilot, Sydney is working at SD-6's office with a girl named Francie? Well, the reason she is working at SD-6 is because the writers thought Sydney would make a better series character if she had an agent at SD-6 (see below). Francie is never referred to again in the entire first season. However, the writers made a slip with Francie's name. The name Sydney gave to Francie's friend Will (whose name is actually Jim Willoughy), whose parents are in the film industry, and Will plays a spy as his uncle. The writers misspelled the spelling of Will's last name to make the connection between Will and Sydney's father's friend, Frank Bristow (who is actually Frank Harcourt). So the name Sydney gave Will's alias was actually spelled wrong.\n\nJenny and Will\n\nCarmen Delgado\n\nDaniel Hecht\n\nFrank Bristow\n\nLoren Bristow\n\nA\n\nB\n\nKate Jones\n\nJim Willoughy\n\nFrank Harcourt\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nMarco Rambaldi\n\nO\n\nP\n\nQ\n\nR\n\nS\n\nSydney Bristow\n\nV\n\nVaughn\n\nW\n\nX\n\nY\n\nZ\n\nJennifer Stevic\n\nMarco Rambaldi\n\nKate Jones & Jim Willoughy\n\nSydney Bristow & Syd (no last name)\n\nFrancie Bristow\n\nAmy Davis\n\nBrief Sketch:\n\nFrancie is Sydney's best friend. She has been Sydney's best friend since she first arrived in Los Angeles and started working as a nanny for Kate Jones, whom Sydney is posing as. However, there was never any intention of Syd getting anywhere near Frank (although after Vaughn gave Syd the info, Vaughn suggested Syd have a go with him). Vaughn also pointed out the fact that Syd should have been aware that Francie was Will's girlfriend when Frank gave her the info. Syd was not aware of this until after Will got shot. Syd didn't even tell Will she had feelings for him until the series ended. But Francie is a good friend anyway. Syd often takes her advice.\n\nTrivia:\n\nFrancie\nOn the pilot, Syd is wearing a white tank top and a pink bra. But in the final cut, the bra is silver.\n\nCarmen Delgado\nOn the first episode, Carmen's real name is Carmen Moncada Delgado. However, the writers decided to change that to the sexy Carmen Delgado because it sounded too boring. The series continues to use Carmen's given name.\n\nThe first episode has a reference to an older Willoughy story. On Alias, Will gets into the elevator with Sydney from the airport, and she asks him if he has a sister. Will says no, but he does have someone waiting for him. On Ally McBeal, Will's best friend is named Carl (short for Carlotta) and she has a sister named Kate.\n\nA\n\nAmy Davis (Amy Pincus) was a well-known comic book artist in the nineties. However, even though she's been out of the field for years, she's still considered popular among comic book fans.\n\nBrief Sketch:\n\nDaniel Hecht is Willoughy's evil father. He runs a shipping company called Brick Enterprises. In the pilot, when Daniel Hecht is coming down the gangplank, he hands off a package he is supposed to deliver to Sydney. It turns out that the package was supposed to go to Sydney and Will's contact was just dropping off something he was supposed to deliver to them. This foreshadows Syd and Frank's first scene together where Willoughy gets caught in a crossfire of fire and Sydney rushes to help.\n\nC\n\nCarmen Delgado\nCarmen",
    "18": "Elena comes home. When she sees Stefan, she hugs him and he confesses he's been waiting for her return so he can finally tell her the truth about who he is. Elena realizes that Stefan is a vampire. Stefan says everything must be the truth no more lies. He takes off the necklace and Elena faints. Stefan takes Elena home.\n\n[Stefan's bedroom.]\nELENA: How do you know that?\nSTEFAN: Your birth certificate from the city records. It says Elena Gilbert. Mystic falls general. But there's no record of your mother ever being admitted.\n\nELENA: What else do you know?\n\nSTEFAN: For me to go any further I would've had to look into the Pierce family and I couldn't do that. It's too much of a risk. If someone found out I was asking about Katherine-- Listen to me, it doesn't matter. You are the woman that I love. I love you.\n\nElena kiss him.\n[Elena's house.]\nJENNA: Why would you lie to me about it?\n\nELENA: Ok. Question-- am I adopted?\n\nJENNA: They asked me not to.\n[AT Damon's car.]\nELENA: So, why did you bring me with you?\n\nDAMON: Well you're not the worst company in the world, Elena. You could give yourself more credit.\n\nELENA: Seriously?\n\nDAMON: You were there in the road. All damsel in distress-like. And I knew it would piss off Stefan. And I knew it would pissoff Stefan. And... U're not the worst company in the world, Elena.\n\nELENA: Okay.\n\nDAMON: That's 3. Do you need a bib?\n\nELENA: Whatever. All right. Who's next? Another round, Bree.\n\nBREE: Go!\n\nThey drink.\n\nELENA: Okay. How many are there?\n\nDAMON: How many in what?\n\nELENA: This town is just a bunch of-- vampires.\n\nDAMON: Vampires can't procreate.\n\nELENA: Is that your answer?\n\nDAMON: Vampires love to try. No. If you are related, it wouldmean Katherine had a child before she was turned.\n\nELENA: And what am I supposed to do now, damon?\n\nDAMON: Let me get you back home. Let me take you to my house. Then, while you're getting over there shock you can have some peace of mind.\n\nELENA: What's the rush? When I make it back, there's no place for me in Mystic Falls anymore. They're probably on their guard for me. We haven't even arrived in town yet. Your mom will probably be there, and we'll get a cold welcome. I'm in no mood for that. I'm just so tired, damon. And I'm pretty bloody sore from all of this.\n\nDAMON: Well, I can't drive.\n\nELENA: You're not serious! You need to get back to town? And what a time for you to realize that?\n\nDAMON: They're going to need me to explain how you got away. Can you trust me?\n\nELENA: You're right.\n\n[In the bar.]\n\nELENA: Let's just say that I'm descended from Katherine-- Does that make me part vampire?\n\nDAMON: Vampires can't procreate.\n\nBREE: The first time you're not supposed to ask for them to put in the order for another round. Come on, what? You don't like pickle? What's wrong with you?\n\nELENA: How can you even eat? If technically you're supposed to be-- dead.\n\nDAMON: Dead.\n\nELENA: Is that true?\n\nDAMON: Dead is not such a bad word. As long as I keep a healthy diet of blood in my system, our body functions pretty normally.\n\nELENA: Where did you learn this?\n\nDAMON: I've been on a college campus, yes. It's good for the soul.\n\nBREE: Here you go, honey.\n\nELENA: Another round. Please. Damon, I can't do this. Do I want to go back home, but for what? This town won't have anything to do with me. They already thought I was dead. And they know where I lived. I'll be a pariah.",
    "19": "I'll be honest, I thought the last episode was pretty good, I was kinda worried about this one because this is the last episode of season 3! and what we have is the second to last episode of the first season, so when I realized the D.A. was trying to get Ryan arrested I was kinda worried for them, so it was a pretty big relief to see Ryan not arrest. although they were about to get arrested, Seth took them to the docks and everything, and we saw that they were going away. I don't think I enjoyed this episode as much because Marissa was still being secretive and she still shot Trey, but on the positive side we got Seth & Summer on the boat which I thought was extremely adorable. it was good to finally see more of them together, although I do miss Summer/Aidan, as I said before I have a feeling we're going to see them again, that just might depend on Aidan. we know that Ryan is still trying to get away and the next episode that airs will be the finale but I think it might be better to watch it when we've finished the first season and second season together. I didn't like the ending of this episode because I don't know. and I'm starting to get a bit tired of Ryan.\n\nNext time\nI see things coming up! the next episode that airs has got to be the finale.
