    "0": "\nThe Federal Reorganization Act of 1949 (FRA) authorizes executive branch agencies to transfer and absorb functions and personnel. The reorganization of U.S. development and foreign investment finance functions authorized by the BUILD Act would have significant impacts on activities within existing government agencies. For example, if a bureau transfers to the IDFC, the IDFC would be responsible for the activities within that bureau. However, it is important to note that the specific functions of existing government agencies are not transferred to the IDFC.\n\n**Legacy USAID Development Programs and Funds**\n\nIn addition to OPIC's various development funds, which support a range of financial tools, legacy USAID development funds carry out financing activities in emerging and developing countries that may be transitioned to the IDFC, as discussed above. A chart of these programs is in the Appendix. In general terms, loans and guarantees supported by these programs finance projects in underserved sub-Saharan African countries under the Energy, Education, Water, Agriculture, and Trade & Investment Programs, as well as development programs in other developing and emerging countries. Specifically, the Development Credit Authority, managed within the Bureau for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment, represents a legacy USAID loan mechanism. Under these programs, loans and guarantees from USAID have generally been made in U.S. currency.\n\n**Existing OPIC Program Functions**\n\nMany legacy OPIC programs do not overlap in operation and purpose with the development-related activities of the IDFC. For example, the Technical Cooperation Program, managed by the Bureau for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment, provides grant assistance for technical assistance in over 200 countries, as well as in Afghanistan and Iraq. This assistance includes capacity building, training activities, trade facilitation, market development, business support services such as legal assistance and assistance in obtaining government permits, as well as direct assistance to businesses and firms. In some ways, this program is closer to a technical assistance program than an investment promotion program, because its focus lies more broadly across developing countries, although its development focus is on assisting \"enterprise promotion\" initiatives. Also, as a grant program, it is more consistent with the core mission of the IDFC to support private-sector activity. The OPIC Business Loan Program, managed by the Office of Policy and Strategy, provides loans to businesses in developing countries to finance projects such as machinery and equipment, software, and other investments in eligible businesses. Unlike OPIC's current investment insurance, the Business Loan Program does not insulate a business' income against losses due to foreign exchange fluctuations. More importantly, it addresses \"investment-ready\" projects with clear profit potential associated with financing activities, but is not meant to support projects with risks arising from political or credit market inefficiencies.\n\n**Transferring Overseas Private Investment Corporation Program Functions to the New IDFC**\n\nAs envisioned by the BUILD Act, much of OPIC is to be transferred to the IDFC, which would manage these programs (excepting the already wind-downd Overseas Technology Investment Program under the Directorate of Entrepreneurship and Financial Services and the Trade & Investment Program under the Directorate of Economic Affairs). A chart detailing the specific authorities that may be shifted is in the Appendix. In general terms, this would include both the OPIC Loan Program, which supports loans, and OPIC's Private Equity and Insurance Programs, both of which support investments and guarantees. Unlike the previous two programs, these support projects from the perspective of creating credit and political risk insurance for private investors. The transition of these authorities requires the approval of the President (subject to review by Congress).\n\n**OPIC Program Limitations**\n\nAlthough it is not envisioned that all of OPIC's program functions will be shifted to the IDFC, there are limitations of what OPIC is able to do due to the statutory definition of its role. For example, a statute requires that the maximum amount of guaranteed credit exposure is equal to the U.S. government's contribution to the fund, which has been set at $29 billion (in USD). Since this is less than half the amount of private-sector capital and credit commitments made in a single OPIC-supported investment project, the limit effectively caps OPIC's maximum amount of guarantee in U.S. currency to $56 million per project. The BRI represents trillions of dollars in investment opportunities that OPIC has not engaged in, nor is it likely to due to several statutory limitations. Other OPIC limitations include an overall maximum authority to commit no more than $23 billion and the authority of not more than a $5 million loan or a $40 million insurance or reinsurance commitment per project.\n\n**OPIC's Business Loan Program**\n\nThe Business Loan Program is in many ways closest in mission to the IDFC\u2014and is sometimes referred to as the \"OPIC",
    "1": "\nAid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, one of the earliest welfare programs created after the New Deal, was replaced at federal level by the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant program, with state responsibility over the administration of the programs. A number of studies of welfare reforms were offered between the 1960s and 1990s. A number of proposals were offered. Finally, the 1996 welfare reform law was passed and became effective on July 1, 1997. Its major reforms of ADC/AFDC were to end TANF cash assistance to single mothers with minor children after two years or upon receipt of a job offer and to include a requirement for work in those two years. The 1996 welfare reform law was reauthorized four times in the following years and extended further on numerous occasions. TANF continued to be reformed and extended beginning in 2009 and in 2012 was reauthorized for another five years. During most of the period from 1997 to 2018, TANF spending was approximately $18 billion per year; it was $14 billion for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. TANF was extended further a number of times during this period, with the most recent extension expiring on June 30, 2019, at the same level of funding as FY2014. \nIn 2019 Congress extended TANF through June 30, 2020.\n\n## 1. History of AFDC and the Welfare Reform Debates\n\nThe early history of the social security program established by the federal government that would bear the name \" AID to Families with Dependent Children \" (AFDC) is an example of the state of social welfare in the first two decades after World War II. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established it in President signed into law the Social Security Act of 1935 (P.L. 74-271). The Social Security Act of 1935 ( P.L. 74-271 ), also known initially as the SSI Act, established two social insurance programs: unemployment insurance (later renamed as Unemployment Compensation) and old-age benefits, and established a federal program of emergency family aid and cash assistance for families \"deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, or continued absence from the home, of a parent; or disability of a parent; or physical or mental incapacity of a parent.\" The 1935 act also provided for the state provision of federal block grants to pay for the activities of state-administered programs for the aged and disabled. \nThe Social Security Act, and those amendments that were enacted before the New Deal ended, provided state programs to assist needy families and their children. \nIn the first half of the 20 th century, family poverty existed largely or almost exclusively among those families led by a widow. Wartime conditions also increased both the number of families receiving federal aid and those with little or no income support from family members. These included families with a working parent, those with a disabled or absent parent, and those families living with both parents.\n\nWhile the early decades of the Social Security Act were relatively uncomplicated, the social welfare needs of children and their families changed in important ways in the 1960s. Many of these changes were prompted by economic and cultural events and were often met with resistance by state and federal governments. The New Deal was replaced in part by the Great Society programs of the 1960s, during which time discussions of how to change or improve AFDC occurred almost constantly. \nChanges that occurred throughout this period included the expansion of the Social Security Act to include survivor's benefits for widows, child and adult disability benefits, and disability insurance, all while allowing for state participation in the administration of these programs. \nIn response to widespread concerns that single women with children were able to collect benefits rather than work, the Social Security Amendments of 1968 (P.L. 90-248), commonly referred to as the Family Support Act, established the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) welfare program and provided work requirements. \nThe welfare reform debate continued into the first decade of the 21 st century, with TANF policy being amended numerous times and an attempt at TANF reform in 2003 and continuing into 2019.\n\n## 2. Welfare Reform Legislation: A Detailed Chronology\n\nSince enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law by President Bill Clinton, Congress has not enacted any additional legislation to govern the federal Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. As noted above, the 1996 TANF law has been reauthorized a number of times. During this period, Congress changed a number of policy provisions relating to the TANF program, and it has extended the program's duration with short-term continuing resolutions for the funding of TANF and other TANF-related programs. The following presents a detailed chronology of TANF and related legislation passed by",
    "2": "Understanding the Law of the River is important for a broad range of interested parties in the basin. \nA brief summary of the key documents and agreements forming the basis of the Law of the River are below.\n\nColorado River Compact. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 apportions annual Colorado River water supplies (7.5 MAF) between the Upper Basin, which receives 51.75% of annual Colorado River flows, and the Lower Basin, which receives the remaining 28.5%. The compact is based on flows as measured at Lee Ferry, AZ; it was modified and amended under the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928, the Upper Colorado River Basin Compact of 1948, and the CRBPA of 1968.\nBoulder Canyon Project Act (BCPA). A legislative compromise between the states of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona to resolve disputes between states about the delivery of Colorado River water. Under BCPA, the Lower Basin was created as a receiving entity for water deliveries from the Upper Basin. The Lower Basin is now dominated by three water uses: agriculture, which receives approximately 5% of annual flow; M&I, which receives approximately 30%; and the Upper Elevation Balancing Tier, at which water supplies may be released to Mexico under the Treaty of 1944.\n\nArizona Ratification and Arizona v. California Decision. The Supreme Court's 1963 decision in Arizona v. California affirmed the Lower Basin's rights to 1/2 of Upper Basin surplus flows and held that the BCPA controls allocation of surplus flows to the Lower Basin. It also held that the upper Colorado River water rights of Native American tribes were protected under the treaty. The 1963 decision also held that water from tributaries of the Colorado River was part of Upper Basin entitlements, and that Reclamation is responsible for determining the Upper Colorado River's allocations based on Colorado River law, and that it is not necessarily subject to prior appropriation rights.\n\n1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. The 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty provides the U.S. with rights to 15 MAF of Colorado River water, and Mexico with similar rights to the waters of the Rio Grande.\n\nUpper Colorado River Basin Compact of 1948. A multi-state agreement among the states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Utah (now also with Arizona) that sets the upper states' river entitlements to 51.75% of available Colorado River flows to the Lower Basin. The Compact also provides the Upper River states with an additional 23% of any Upper Basin runoff for non-consumptive use of Colorado River water.\n\nCRSP Act (CRBPA). In 1963, CRSPA authorized federal projects and authorizes certain Upper Basin States to develop their Colorado River entitlements through reservoirs in the Upper Basin (e.g., Lake Powell and the Flaming Gorge Dam Unit of the CRSP). Also allows for the Lower Basin allocation of 75 MAF of the Upper Basin's yearly average Colorado River flow (which will occur after 10-year periods). The act established the Upper Colorado River Commission, which is responsible for implementing CRBPA operations and agreements.\n\nColorado River Storage Project Act (CRSPA). In 1956, CRSPA authorized the construction of storage and dam projects on the Colorado River for use in meeting the needs of the Lower Basin. The CRSPA also established the Colorado River Storage Project Fund, which is funded by the Upper Colorado River and Lower Colorado River Basin Development Funds. Funds from the fund are to mitigate impacts on the environment and restore and enhance threatened, endangered, or sensitive species species.\n\nColorado Basin Salinity Control Act (P.L. 93-320 ). Congress created programs to manage and protect water quality, including the Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish Program, the Navajo-Gallup Water Supply Project, and the Animas-La Plata/Central Utah Project.\n\n1924: Colorado River Compact: Ratified, 1923.\n\n1925\u20131929: Boulder Canyon Project Act: Passed (May, 1929); ratified, 1933.\n\n1953: 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty: Signed (December 14, 1944).\n\n1963: Supreme Court Decision: Arizona v. California.\n\n1968: Colorado River Basin Project Act (CRBPA): Passed (July 29, 1968).\n\n1973: ESA: Enacted (October 23, 1973).\n\n1974: San Juan River basin Recovery: Authorizing Legislation: P.L. 93-320.\n\n1981: Colorado River Basin Salinity Control: Authorizing Legislation: P.L. 93-320.\n\n1985: San Juan River Basin Recovery: Authorizing Legislation: P.L. 93-320.\n\n1992: Upper Colorado River Endangered",
    "3": "\nFederal tort claims against the government fall into two general categories: (1) suing the United States itself and (2) suing individual federal employees within the scope of their employment. In either situation, to obtain monetary compensation, a plaintiff must typically follow certain procedural and substantive requirements. When a plaintiff sues the government, the plaintiff must notify the appropriate federal agency of his claim and allow the agency sufficient time to consider the claim before the plaintiff may commence an FTCA action in federal court. This time requirement is called \"exhaustion.\"\n\nTo bring a tort suit directly against a federal employee, the plaintiff must present his claim to the relevant federal agency prior to filing suit. After receiving this notice, a private agency is required \"to decide whether or not to settle the claim.\" If the claimant fails to exhaust administrative administrative remedies within two years of the alleged tort and the agency disagrees with the claim, then the plaintiff's claim will be \"barred\" and he will lose the opportunity to initiate a judicial action against the federal government.\n\nThe FTCA also limits the types and amounts of monetary damages that a plaintiff may recover if he prevails in his lawsuit. A plaintiff's damages may not exceed the amount he initially requested from the relevant agency when submitting his administrative claim. The FTCA has procedural and substantive limitations that can prevent plaintiffs from obtaining their desired monetary awards.\n\nA plaintiff suing a federal employee generally has two potential targets for his monetary claim: the employee and the United States. When suing the federal government, the plaintiff must exhaust his administrative remedies before suing the government in a civil lawsuit in federal court. If a plaintiff sues an individual employee, the plaintiff may recover from either the employee himself or the government itself. The FTCA, however, expressly shields individual federal employees from individual tort liability for torts committed within the scope of their employment. Consequently, the only way to recover monetary damages from a federal employee is through the FTCA. Under certain circumstances, however, the FTCA does not protect an employee from liability but instead permits him to be sued in his personal capacity.\n\nWhile the FTCA generally limits a plaintiff's ability to obtain monetary compensation for a FTCA claim, it also establishes certain exceptions allowing a plaintiff to bring such an action even despite the substantive limitations discussed above. Such exceptions include the discretionary function exception, which shields the government from liability for discretionary acts by its employees; the exception to the discretionary function exception, which shields the government from liability for law enforcement officers; and the law enforcement proviso, which waives the United States's immunity in specific kinds of cases involving law enforcement officers.\n\nWhile the FTCA generally places heavy procedural burdens on private plaintiffs, Congress has provided an exception to a FTCA plaintiff's exhaustion requirement by authorizing constructive exhaustion. Similarly, the FTCA has statutory provisions that grant Congress the authority to pass private legislation affording private litigants financial relief they otherwise would lack. Congress may use that statutory authority to pass private bills authorizing or otherwise approving monetary awards to particular plaintiffs.\n\nC. \nMUNICIPAL TORT CLAIMS\nThere has been much debate over the effectiveness of \"the government being put on notice of potential liabilities.\" Because an agency is not bound by judicial precedent under the Administrative Procedure Act, and because federal contractors often enjoy immunity from liability, an agency may never be required to reveal its mistakes. A private citizen, by contrast, is bound by judicial precedent\u2014if he does not litigate his case in a court of appeals. Thus, if an agency commits fraud in court, its lawyers must reveal that fraud to the court.\n\nBy contrast, an agency caught in a non-judicial proceeding, such as a legislative hearing, generally has no legal duty to reveal its potential liability. Congress did not intend to force an agency to reveal its mistakes in a public forum. A contractor, by contrast, has a clearly defined legal duty to reveal fraud in public forums. If the United States acts without good faith, it will face the public consequences of those actions.\n\nThe Administrative Procedure Act does not create this dilemma. If an agency wishes to put before Congress or the other agencies its mistakes, then it can be held in contempt for noncompliance with a Congressional request. An agency knows full well that the courts may find it in contempt if it willfully or recklessly denies the truth before Congress.\n\n\"Thus, when Congress has authorized a particular agency to make a particular mistake, the agency can safely rely upon the fact that there exists a means for it to be held in contempt.\" \nBecause government attorneys generally consider it unhelpful to face the consequences of fraud, it may use the same rationale to conceal a failure to reveal a mistake before Congress as it would use to conceal a failure to reveal a mistake before the court in a judicial proceeding.... \n\"Congress, of course, could have expressly required federal agencies to",

    "5": "\nNatural disasters affect U.S. farmers and ranchers in a variety of ways: through severe and adverse weather, crop infection or crop disease, and catastrophic events such as wildfire and severe storms. The federal government helps farmers and ranchers recover from financial losses caused by these types of natural disasters in a variety of ways: through federal crop insurance, NAP, and emergency loans; state and private assistance programs; and ad hoc measures such as individual disaster assistance and Section 32 and CCC funds.\n\nThe primary way the federal government helps farmers and ranchers through federal assistance programs is by providing premium subsidies for federal crop insurance policies. These policies allow farmers to protect themselves from losses associated with weather, plant disease or insect infestation, and commodity price declines. Under these programs, the federal government either makes up the premium they would otherwise pay or pays part of the premium directly to the private insurance company. In either case, farmers have the option to buy the insurance at their own expense or elect to receive no payment under the program.\n\nThe federal government also offers three livestock disaster assistance programs, NAP, and LFP, that pay assistance for losses not covered by crop insurance or crop disaster assistance policies. NAP and LFP help producers receive a higher indemnity when their loss exceeds the minimum loss threshold, as set by the program or program regulations. LFP can also provide payments to producers whose crops are not eligible under NAP or crop insurance, such as grazing land. These programs have higher service fees but no premiums. They may have payment limits, but the vast majority of participants do not pay service fees.\n\nWhile there are no fees to participate in USDA's emergency disaster assistance programs, producers must meet eligibility requirements. LFP payments are generally triggered by drought severity over a number of months, and LIP payments are based on estimated breeding values of covered livestock livestock. Eligible producers receive either 60% or 80% of estimated feeding costs per month for livestock, and up to 80% of the value of feed sold at a reduced price under livestock price support programs, depending on the severity of the drought. ELAP compensates producers for the loss of livestock not covered by other types of disaster assistance or for mortality losses not included under other programs. Payments are generally limited in amount and duration of assistance but may be received in addition to payments from other disaster assistance programs. Tree Assistance Program helps orchardists and others in the tree, bush, and vine farming industries recover from damage to plantings from a natural disaster. Payments are generally limited in amount.\n\nMany other federal disaster assistance programs also exist to help agricultural producers recover from the financial and productivity losses resulting from an adverse weather event, such as EWP, EFRP, ECP, ELAP, LIP, and TAP. Additional emergency assistance programs are also authorized, such as WHIP, for producers experiencing losses caused by natural disasters in past years.\n\nWhile USDA has several emergency disaster assistance programs in place to provide support, many agricultural losses are not covered by any federal funding programs. Instead, many producers must bear the risk of such losses entirely themselves and rely on assistance from the states, county, and other sources to assist in recovery and recovery efforts.\n\nThe primary federal disaster assistance program that helps producers recover from agricultural losses is crop insurance for insurable commodities. Currently, the federal government supports the premiums for crop insurance policies (through premium fees or premium subsidies) through ad hoc emergency disaster assistance programs (such as WHIP or the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018). Over the past ten years, the federal government has provided ad hoc disaster assistance to agricultural producers in six separate years (2011-2012, 2014, and 2017, and Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018).\n\nWhile there is no guarantee that the federal government will continue providing supplemental disaster assistance to agricultural producers in the future, past Congresses have periodically authorized such assistance. In the 115th Congress, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 authorized emergency disaster assistance to producers experiencing losses as a result of hurricanes and wildfires in two separate years\u20142017 and 2018.\n\nOver the past ten years, the federal government has provided supplemental disaster assistance to agricultural producers in the amount of $11 billion, using funds authorized through the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and as part of the annual agriculture appropriations. Payments made under these programs are in addition to disaster assistance that may be funded through regular USDA disaster assistance programs and by Section 32 and CCC.\n\nThe federal government also offers several permanent disaster assistance programs that are available on an ongoing basis but require no government funding. These programs include federal crop insurance, NAP, agricultural disaster insurance, and emergency loans.\n\nNatural disaster losses affect farming operations in a wide variety of ways, including through decreased yields, damage to livestock and poultry, and declines in the profitability of other agricultural activities. Over the past eight years,",

These changes include allowing for additional types of water infrastructure projects (which were previously unavailable), to finance with new types of financial tools, and in some cases to expand nonfederal participation in supporting project financing. These provisions in turn have raised interest among federal agencies for exploring additional types of local support, including public-private funding partnerships. \nThe major federal water and waste disposal programs described in this report provide assistance to communities to construct, retrofit, upgrade, or maintain drinking water, wastewater, or irrigation infrastructure, including stormwater and flood management. In total, these programs have authorized more than $250 billion in project funding since 1980, with more than $90 billion in appropriations to date for projects authorized under the federal water and waste disposal programs.

In 1936, the program was transferred to a dedicated fund by the Flood Control Act of 1936 (P.L. 79-575, 42 Stat. 1286). The program was reauthorized in the Flood Control Act of 1936 (P.L. 79-575), as amended, 49 Stat. 1438.

Of the $80 billion increase from last year to 2016, an estimated $7 billion increase is expected as a result of cost growth (due to higher prices charged by vendors for goods and services, delays in project completion, etc.) and $73 billion due to inflationary cost increases (which have outpaced cost growth in government procurement budgets). Another $31 billion increase is expected from planned funding increases.... Of the $80 billion expected in new funding... $48 billion is expected to increase the cost of major defense acquisition programs already under way, and $32 billion to support new major defense acquisition programs.... If the DoD is unable to meet the goal of achieving cost growth restraint, the expected $5.8 billion increase from cost growth and $3.5 billion increase from inflationary cost increases will offset an estimated $2.5 billion decrease in the size of DoD's major programs force from anticipated program savings and reduced requirements.\nAnother 2013 GAO report stated that:\n\nDOD has implemented measures to slow the growth of DoD costs over the last eight years, primarily by controlling cost growth in the major DoD acquisition programs. At the same time, DoD continues to experience cost growth in its major acquisition programs... because the major acquisition programs have experienced more inflation than budget increases, and their DoD program managers have continued to increase DoD budget funding despite cost growth. By 2016, these programs' funding will exceed the costs they accrued. As a result, DoD will continue to face significant budget challenges to achieving cost restraint even if the cost growth in these programs is reduced. These budget challenges arise because DoD's major acquisition programs account for a large portion of DoD's total acquisition budget and the DoD acquisition programs cost more than the Department's entire research, development, test, and evaluation budget and approximately 80 percent of all DoD programs' costs.\nFurther, the GAO noted above, the government pays twice for a major acquisition program: once to procure the program and once to fix the inevitable cost growth in the program due to product life and support.\nIn the Navy, the GAO has issued four reports on shipbuilding cost estimates between FY2008 and FY2017:\n\n February 2013 GAO report A-22, Navy Shipbuilding Costs: Better Data Could Provide Better Scanning of Costs and Costs Are Higher for Certain Ship Classes (as of April 2013)\n\n May 2013 GAO report A-13, Navy Shipbuilding Costs: Navy Could Further Reduce Shipbuilding Production Costs through Increased Competition for Contracts (as of May 2013)\n\nOctober 2013 GAO report A-19, Navy Shipbuilding Costs: Navy Could Better Manage Shipbuilding Contracts (as of October 2013)\n\n February 2014 GAO report A-15, Navy Shipbuilding Costs: Increased Shipbuilding Production Is Likely to Increase Navy Ship Production Costs, but Navy Can Also Reduce Ship Costs by Better Preparing Contractors and Using Competition (as of February 2014)\nIn the GAO reports cited above, it was reported that in FY2008, cost growth in Navy shipbuilding programs ranged from 20 percent to 100 percent.\nSeveral months ago, on February 8, 2018, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense stated the following:\nFor years, we have identified the Navy's shipbuilding programs as the department's best opportunity for savings. Yet, despite our efforts... spending on the Navy's shipbuilding budget will be higher than it was in FY 2017, in spite of a 3 percent cut in base spending.... The shipbuilding budget continues to face pressures from increased ship life-cycle support costs, including higher fuel prices and the need for more support ships at forward bases....\n\nThese pressures would be reduced by the adoption of a shipbuilding policy that emphasized acquisition reform, such as a better use of competition and a more efficient contracting process. The department may need to pursue these policies more aggressively to avoid the risk of the Navy's current shipbuilding budget becoming a drain on base and operations programs....\n\nWhile the Navy is seeking more",

This includes $27.4 million for a sub-project within line 263, which includes the Surface Combatant Craft Assault, Surface Combatant Craft Mission Equipment, Shallow Water Combat Submersible, Underwater Systems, and dry combat submersibles for Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The FY2020 budget request for line 263 also includes the procurement of Underwater Systems for $27.4 million to help support Special Operations Command (SOCOM).\nThe FY2020 budget request for line 63 for Project S1684 includes $15.6 million for a program element number (PE) consisting of Underwater Systems for Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for procurement of Underwater Systems.\n\nNavy Irregular Warfare\n\nThe Navy in July 2015 conducted an operation in Somalia that led to the death of a suspected terrorist, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame. Warsame, who has yet to be charged in an American court, is the subject of an October 12, 2015, report by Jane's Information Group.\n\nAnother press report states, regarding the October 12, 2015, operation, that\n\nThe operation marks the first time in a dozen years the U.S.-flagged ship, the USNS Pfc. Richard J. Donovan, came under fire while providing security in war-torn Somalia. U.S. and Somalia authorities took no action against the unidentified aggressor vessel.\n\nThe episode illustrates the complex operating environment into which U.S. forces may soon confront themselves, a U.S. Navy source said.\nThe operation took place on October 12 in southern Somalia, off the coast of Harardhur, where the ship had been providing transportation and other shore support to the local African Union Mission. As the local mission was conducting a \"security forum,\" the Navy had planned to operate near the coast.\n\nIn the pre-dawn hours, a suspected Shabaab boat approached. The U.S. Navy was able to maneuver within its designated area and \"provide security for the AU mission,\" the source said. At that point the unknown vessel, a suspected Shabaab fishing boat, \"fired a single round across the ship's bow,\" though it did not do any damage.\n\nThe U.S. and Somalian authorities are still trying to clarify precisely what happened. Warsame was among the crewmembers of a suspected Shabaab boat that was not seen again. The crew did not surrender nor did they attempt to flee. \"The ship was escorted to the Mogadishu Naval Support Facility.\"\n\nThis is one of the first serious incidents since 2009 of pirates or other forces firing upon a U.S. military ship, said the source. That year, a similar incident resulted in the death of eight American sailors aboard the USS Benfold....\n\nThe U.S. naval force was operating in international waters, not in a war zone, the U.S. Navy source confirmed. The U.S. Navy and Somalian authorities are cooperating with each other on the incident.\n\nAn October 17, 2015, press report says the following:\nU.S. forces took a small boat with three crew and one passenger aboard out of the water in southern Somalia on Oct. 12. The individual was a known terrorist who had been detained by U.S. forces on two separate occasions.\n\nU.S. authorities seized the small boat and detained the suspect on Oct. 12 in international waters. He is believed to be the same individual captured on Oct. 8 off the Horn of Africa coast and questioned on board a U.S. naval vessel from Oct. 7-10 before being transported to the United States.\n\nThe individual was a member of the Shabaab. There was no indication the incident involved any hostile intent against the U.S. forces. The individual has been held on the U.S. naval vessel ever since, and remains in the custody of U.S. authorities. Additional information will be provided when available.\n\nA June 24, 2016, press report states the following:\nThe Navy and Marine Corps Special Operations Forces community supports a robust training, education, research and development (T/E/R/D) portfolio, including several projects aimed at enhancing the combat effectiveness of special operations forces for future tasks and environments. This investment enables SOCOM to acquire innovative and advanced capabilities in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and ensures the operational success,",

Executive Summary\n\nThe Energy Technology Engineering Center and Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Project have been evaluated by GAO in previous reports.\n\n## 1.1. Executive Summary\n\nTo manage and track the cleanup work at the 16 DOE-controlled sites, the Environmental Management (EM) cleanup program has entered into agreements with multiple federal and state regulatory agencies and other DOE offices. These agreements contain a series of milestones, but the Environmental Management (EM) office does not consistently define and track milestones. As a result, sites do not always report this information accurately, or in a standard format acceptable to EM headquarters. These weaknesses limit EM's ability to monitor cleanup performance and set realistic and achievable milestones. As part of our continuing review of DOE's compliance with a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act, GAO conducted this review of EM's cleanup milestones. (See figure 1.)\n\nGAO has previously found that agencies often track completion milestones according to different definitions and requirements. This, in turn, often results in milestones not being tracked consistently, which, in turn, makes it difficult to set realistic and achievable milestones, and hinders agencies' abilities to monitor their performance successfully.\n\nGAO recommends that DOE update EM's policies and procedures to establish a standard definition of milestones and specify requirements for both including and updating information on milestones across the complex. (See recommendation 1 in the recommendations section.)\n\nGAO also recommends that",
    "10": "\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) pays unemployment insurance  benefits to individuals in 49 states and Puerto Rico to help them  re-enter the labor market in times of  unemployment and to provide a safety net for those who lose  their jobs through no fault of their own at the state level.  The amount of unemployment insurance benefits paid and the  duration of the benefit are determined according to state laws  and regulations, which states are expected to administer under federal  oversight.\n\nDOL uses the Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) program to  determine the accuracy of UI benefit payments and to estimate   \nthe amount and rates of improper payments. Under the BAM program, each  \nstate selects a random week of paid claims during the fiscal year and identifies  \nerrors in the handling of the case. State BAM investigators then reconstruct  \nthe benefits paid for the sample cases to help clarify the UI laws and  \npolicies that the state applied when processing the cases.  \n\n  If after reviewing the reconstruction of benefit payments for  \nthe sample cases, the state finds that the UI laws and policies  \npermitting the paid UI claim are in accordance with federal law  \nand the state's administrative regulations and practices, there has  \nbeen no improper payment.\n\nIf the state finds that the UI laws, regulations, and  \npractices did not follow federal law and the administrative practices are not  \nconsistent with the state's laws and regulations, then the state  \ndetermines the benefit amount that should have been paid and determines  \nthe rate of improper payments.\n\nIn accordance with federal law, individuals receive  \nunemployment insurance benefits by filing claims with the Unemployment Insurance  \nagency in their state, which generally is a state  \ndepartment. State agencies then determine whether the  \nindividual is eligible for unemployment insurance benefits, including whether  \nthe individual has satisfied relevant state and federal law and regulation  \nrequirements.\n\nDOL uses Bam data to determine states' improper payment rates   \nand to quantify and assess work search overpayments.\n\n  Some states have administered their unemployment insurance programs  \nwith less frequency of BAM reviews and lower work search overpayment  \nrates than others, as shown in fig. 1. States have also had  \ndifferent work search requirements for claimants in similar circumstances and  \nvary in whether they warned claimants for work search overpayments when they  \ndetected errors.\n\n  The majority of estimated work search overpayment errors in the UI program  \n(about 41 percent) are associated with claimants. Claims by these  \nclaimants are considered a greater risk for error. For example, some  \nclaimants might not properly report required work search activities or report the amount  \nof wages earned.\n\nDespite DOL's recent directive to discontinue use of  \nstate formal warnings, states remain inconsistent in whether they count as  \noverpayments cases in which claimants fail to search for work and are given benefits. DOL does not monitor states' responses to this policy differently (see fig. 2).\n\nAccording to DOL's BAM data, the estimated work search   \noverpayment rate is 4.5 percent. States have different work search overpayment  \nrates that vary from an estimated 0 percent to an estimated 41 percent. Most  \nstates' work search overpayment rates are less than 5 percent. For example, there is an  \nestimated average work search overpayment rate of 1.0 percent in Nevada, which is  \nthe state with the lowest rate. DOL officials stated this lower  \noverpayment rate may reflect that the state has stringent work search  \nrequirements as compared to other states.\n\nWe conducted an ongoing study to analyze potential factors associated  \nwith states' work search overpayment rate estimates. We found five  \nfactors associated with work search overpayment rates: eligibility,  \neligibility administration, employment services registration, work search activities,  \nand work search verification.\n\nWe provided DOL with the results of our study, in accordance with GAO's standard practices in responding to  \nagency requests for help. In their written comments, DOL agreed with our four recommendations.\n\nRecommendation 1:\n\nThe Assistant Secretary of DOL's Employment and Training  \nAdministration should provide states with information about DOL's determination that the use of state formal warning policies is no longer per  \nmissible under federal law.\n\nReason:\n\nTo provide states with sufficient information about DOL's determination that formal warning  \npolicies are not permitted under federal law, DOL should describe the specific provisions of federal law.\n\nAction:\n\nFor example, in the letter to the states that includes the fiscal year 2016  ",

Because of delays in developing and implementing core capabilities  described in the 2017 update and implementation of post-core additions  despite funding restrictions, DHS has not yet deployed full  operational capacity of the system. As a result, other agencies  identified as bearing responsibility for cargo import processing, including other  federal agencies that license specific commodities, have only a  limited use of ACE data for their import duties and  security purposes.\n\n\nOur analysis of CBP's ACE acquisition process reveals significant delays  and errors in estimating system functionality and costs.  We also found that CBP has not developed metrics  adequate to determine the actual benefits of ACE and will face  unresolved organizational challenges to achieve the full benefits  anticipated from ACE deployment. If DHS had continued   \nto implement ACE incrementally as initially planned, CBP was predicted to  finish implementing ACE with all core capabilities fully deployed   \nand operational capacity fully realized by November 2016; instead, DHS cancelled all new ACE   \ndevelopment in 2010, causing CBP to delay completion of core  capabilities by an  extra 11  years.\n\nWhile the DHS acquisition decision memorandum issued in February   \n2014 reaffirmed the commitment to complete full ACE functionality, CBP was unable   \nto finalize an approach to managing ACE after core  \ncapabilities are completed. This has resulted in significant delays  \nand increased program costs.\n\nDHS should ensure that CBP, in collaboration with its  \npartner agencies, finalizes and implements appropriate processes for  \nprioritizing enhancements to ACE, sharing the costs of ACE operations and  \ndevelopment among partners, and finalizing time frames for implementing processes for  \nprioritizing and improving ACE   \n\nOur evaluation of ACE use was conducted in two phases. The first phase entailed  \nconducting case studies to compare each agency's experiences in processing  \nimports under the existing Automated Commercial System (ACS) compared  \nwith the ACE functionality available at that agency and what the agency  \nanticipates ACE will bring to the import process when all core   \ncapabilities are completed. During the second phase, we conducted interviews to better understand  \nthe use and benefits of ACE that agencies and companies anticipated from  \nimplementing ACE full operational capacity, including challenges for using ACE through  \nits completion.\n\nIn the  Table of Contents  \n\nin this Chapter\n\n  Chapter 1 | Background   \n---|---  \n  Chapter 2 | CBP's ACE Acquisition Process  \n|    \n  Chapter 3 | Trade Community   \n|    \n  Chapter 4 | CBP's Approach to ACE After Core  \nCapabilities Have Been Completed   \n|    \n  Chapter 5 | Agency Use of ACE  \n|    \n  Chapter 6 | Agency Benefits and Challenges, and Our  \nConcerns with  \nACE   \n|    \n  Chapter 7 | DHS Acquisition Decision  \nMemorandum   \n|    \n  Chapter 8 | Processes for Managing ACE and  \nImproving Benefits and Costs for CBP and its  \nPartner Agencies\n|    \n  Chapter 9 | Recommendation for Executive   \nAction; Agency Comments and Our Evaluation\n|    \n|    \n\n  1.

EPA regulates drinking water contaminants under the Safe Drinking  Water Act by issuing legally enforceable standards, known as National  Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which generally limit the levels of  these contaminants in public water systems. EPA has issued such  regulations for approximately 90 drinking water contaminants. In  accordance with the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA may authorize a state  to have primary enforcement responsibility for drinking water regulations,  as long as the state has, among other things, drinking water regulations  that are no less stringent than the National Primary Drinking Water  Regulations.\n\n Drinking water systems are comprised of water towers, piping  grids, pumps, and other components to deliver treated water from  treatment systems to consumers.\n\n The Safe Drinking Water Act also authorizes EPA to take emergency  actions necessary to protect public health when informed that a  contaminant is present in or is likely to enter a public water system or an  underground source of drinking water that may present an imminent and  substantial endangerment. For example, EPA may issue administrative orders, which generally include actions to be taken, such as remediating  contaminated sources of drinking water or requiring the provision of  alternative water supplies. State regulators may also issue orders to  public water systems to address contaminated drinking water.\n\n DOD public water systems, including the DOD public water systems that  provide drinking water to about 3 million people living and working on  military installations, are required to comply with EPA and state drinking  water regulations. EPA divides violations of drinking water regulations  into two types: (1) health-based violations and (2) other types of  violations that include violations of monitoring, reporting, and public  notification requirements. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA also  is required to identify unregulated contaminants that present the greatest  health concern, establish a program to monitor drinking water for  unregulated contaminants, and decide whether or not to regulate at least  five such contaminants every 5 years. EPA has not regulated any new  contaminants using this process since 1996.\n\n DOD publishes a policy on the identification, assessment, and risk  management of emerging contaminants that have the potential to impact DOD. According to  this policy, chemicals and materials used or planned for use by DOD that meet  the definition of an emerging contaminant should be identified as early as possible. The policy further states that DOD is to assess and, when appropriate, take action to reduce risks posed by its emerging contaminants to people; the environment; and DOD missions, programs, and resources. Where necessary, DOD is to perform sampling, conduct site-specific  risk assessments, and take response actions for emerging contaminants released from DOD facilities, in accordance with relevant statutes.\n\n Based on the DOD policy on emerging contaminants, ASD (EI&E) is to develop and maintain a list of emerging contaminants with potential or  probable high risk to the department's personnel and functions.  This list includes 49 chemicals or substances. According to our analysis of EPA documents, DOD's list includes 21 contaminants that can be found in drinking water. Of these 21  contaminants, 10 contaminants have been regulated by EPA  under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and 11 contaminants are currently unregulated but have an EPA-issued drinking water health advisory. The other 28 DOD-identified emerging  contaminants do not have EPA drinking water  regulations or health advisories.\n\nDOD has not completed its drinking water program evaluation under the",
    "15": "\nGSA Has Incorporated Key Considerations Related to Long-Term O&M Costs and Building Functionality  into Its Policies for  Producing Design Plans for New Design Excellence Buildings and  Producing Facility Space Plans for Existing Buildings\n\nGeneral Services Administration (GSA) officers told us that its  process for planning and designing new Design Excellence buildings addresses certain  GSA officials have initiated several actions to better address the  consideration of O&M costs and functional aspects such as  accessibility, egress, and acoustics when designing new buildings. As a result,  GSA anticipates the long-term operations and maintenance (O&M) cost of newer  buildings will be lower than older buildings. GSA also  has taken action to better document building maintenance needs and build  capacity in existing buildings. However, GSA is not  consistent in implementing these actions and as a result, has not  fully addressed all considerations that could affect O&M costs and building functionality.\n\nThe Office of Design and Construction (ODC), an office of GSA  charged with designing, constructing, renovating, and repairing federal  facilities, developed a Design Guidelines Handbook that calls for  consideration of functionality, design creativity, long-term O&M, and constructability factors when designing new federal buildings. The Design Guidelines Handbook also requires that all buildings incorporate accessibility requirements. In addition, GSA  has procedures in place to update these guidelines based on best practices, experience, and industry trends. The use of the Design Guidelines Handbook in new buildings is a major effort to systematically design buildings that are not just  better for government workers, but also represent the dignity,  enterprise, vigor and the stability of the U.S. government.\n\nWhile GSA has included certain considerations related to long-  term O&M costs and building function in its procedures  and guidance, O&M remains a major focus of the Design Excellence Program  after-construction. GSA building managers and regional officials  responsible for managing O&M reported that they have struggled with maintaining O&M costs and facilities function due to a lack of consideration of these factors in the plan-  and design stage. This challenge may be due to GSA officials considering  the cost of long-term facility maintenance and repairs in the planning and  design of new buildings, but not during the execution of those projects. One GSA  building manager described the lack of considerations that are included in the  planning and design stage as \"an omission of critical factors that might increase [O&M]  cost and decrease functionality.\"\n\nIn addition, GSA building managers also reported that they have not  received enough information to adequately consider the O&M consequences of the  design choices GSA made. For example, GSA building managers emphasized that the lack of formalized information collection processes means that critical information can be missed or delayed. As one federal building manager told us, \"I can't be the only guy  responsible for this when I don't have the  necessary information to make an informed decision that could  cause [O&M] costs to increase.\"\n\n   GAO Recommendations:\n\nThe Administrator of the General Services Administration should  ensure that the Design Guidelines Handbook and procedures for  updating the guidance take into consideration all issues relevant to O&M  costs and building functionality. (Recommendation 1)\n\nThe Administrator of the General Services Administration should  require GSA officials conducting facility space development to collect   and share information on operational and maintenance (O&M) costs,  and associated considerations, with project teams. (Recommendation 2)\n\nThe  Administrator of the General Services Administration should  ensure that GSA officials providing design plans for new Federal  buildings, including Design Excellence buildings, include information on building function and design considerations that could affect O&M costs. (Recommendation 3)\n\nAppendix IV: Agency Comments\n\nGSA responded to each of our recommendations in writing. GSA noted that it is currently revising and updating the Design Guidelines Handbook for new buildings to align it with the needs of GSA customers.\n\nAccording to GSA, its procedures for identifying a facility space  plan (FSD) for existing buildings already include instructions on facility space planning. Additionally, GSA building managers noted that many building managers often review facility space plans with facility space requesters and project team  officials as part of the lease- negotiation process.\n\nAs we noted in the report, GSA building managers explained that  lack of information often causes challenges with building operation and maintenance (O&M).\n\nAppendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\n\n  Keith Cunningham (Assistant Director); Matt Daly (Analyst in Charge); Josh Feingold;  ",

Specifically, during our July 2017 review of the  Department's excess controlled property program, we identified five overall  deficiencies:  \n\n\u2022DOD has not adopted written policies or procedures to govern its  processes for transferring excess controlled property, including those that would guide the selection of an agency to receive excess controlled property and ensure accountability for the transfer of excess controlled property  \n\n\u2022DOD officials have not developed a written policy or procedure for overseeing and approving the distribution of excess controlled property  \n\n\u2022DOD has not adopted a comprehensive fraud risk framework that includes an explicit  policy statement on risk acceptance and assessment activities  \n\n\u2022DOD has not issued guidance to clarify the term executive order controlled, which  confuses the DOD transfer process and interferes with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies' ability to transfer excess controlled property  \n\n\u2022DOD officials have not developed written training on its excess controlled property  program that defines the terms and conditions of participation in the program  \n\n\u2022DOD has not issued guidance to clarify the definitions of excess controlled property  \n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD)\u2013led and DOD-managed and -operated programs, including the Excess Controlled Property (LESO) program, transfer excess controlled property to federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies at no cost to federal, state,  and local agencies. As specified in law, the program's transfer processes are not governed by written policy or procedure.\n\nThis statement is based on our evaluation of DOD's  processes for transferring and monitoring excess controlled  property, the LESO program, through a review of policies  and procedures, interviews, and independent testing.\n\nGAO recommends DOD adopt written policies and procedures to govern its  \nprocesses for transferring excess controlled property, including those that would guide  \nthe selection of an agency to receive excess controlled property and ensure accountability  \nfor the transfer of excess controlled property.\n\nContacts: Zina Merritt   \n(202) 512-5257   \nmrmerritt@gao.gov   \nGeorge Ogilvie   \n(202) 512-2905   \nmcelrathw@gao.gov\n\n1 The LESO program makes excess controlled property available to government  and non-government entities, including academic research organizations and  \nnoncommercial public-use entities, via requests through DLA's online system.  \nFederal law enforcement agencies, which include: (1) the Department of  \nHomeland Security, (2) the U.S. Secret Service, and (3) the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, may also receive excess controlled property for certain  \nnational security activities from the LESO program.\n\n2 As identified in the 2018 DoD Budget Estimate, the Department will use unallocated appropriation authority to fund the  \nLESO program's expenses in 2017\u20132027. Based on publicly available budget documents  \nand estimates, it is unclear whether DOD will fund the LESO program beyond Fiscal Year 2027.\n\n3 For example, the Program Director of the Army's Joint  \nLand Enterprise Program, which includes LESO, stated the program will  \nmake equipment available that the Army did not need, freeing up money for additional   \nmissions as the Army has experienced budget reductions.\n\n4 The Excess Controlled Property Program Handbook further states that there is no   \nlimit on the number of items a single agency can request.\n\n5 GAO notes the Department has made efforts to correct this issue and as stated in  Chapter 1, Paragraph 6.1 that DOD made revisions to  \ninstructions to clarify the definitions of excess controlled property in its  \npolicy, which we acknowledge.\n\n6 For example, the law enforcement agencies we interviewed and visited (e.g., the  \nBureau of Indian Affairs, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Federal  \nProtective Service, and Albuquerque Police Department) stated that their  \nuse of the LESO program's equipment saved them substantial money.\n\n6.3.1 Contributing Expert\n\nMr. George Ogilvie provided comments and edits for this paragraph.\n\n7 For example, we spoke with an Assistant Director to discuss the  \nprocess of applying for and receiving excess controlled assets. The Assistant Director further stated that his  \nsupervisor reviewed the application before submitting it to DOD.\n\n8 For example, GAO contacted the Department to request DOD data on its  \nexcess controlled property transfers.

It is to do  \nwith the telling of a tale, and  \nso that the tale may be complete  \nthe words must tell at least a portion of  \na man's life. I have tried  \nto do that with this story.  \nThe truth is, in these pages I\nPart One\n\nSummer  \n\nOne\n\nThe light had begun to fail,  \nand the shadows had lengthened on the  \nhighroad when the troop of horsemen,  \ntheir cloaks whipping in a summer wind,  \ncame galloping into Rook's  \nHold. I was in the tavern,  \nwatching the flames on the hearth,  \nand thinking on my ale, to hear  \nthe rider on the doorstep,  \nand I would have slept at once,  \nhad the bell tolled on the  \nhold's small gong, and the sound  \nof it woke me at once. And yet. At first I didn't hear it well. The sound is faint, especially when the winter wind  \nis blowing so hard, and that day it  \nwas blowing hard, rattling the thatch  \nacross the hold. And still,  \nit was no more than a thin sound in  \nthe stillness, and maybe some other  \nsound had made me start and the sound  \ncame to my ears, I don't know,  \nas I went to the door. In  \na blink the candle was burning  \ndown to the last guttered cinder, a  \nthin gray streak of light across the  \nroom's darkening floor, and the light  \nwas going out and it wouldn't come  \nback and the world grew darker.  \nThat's the moment I saw the rider  \nin the doorway, though. And  \nin another blink, with the candle  \ngone out, there was just the  \ndarkness outside and the rider in the  \ndarkness and me in the dark.\n\nI wasn't afraid, then. I am  \nnot a man to be afraid of dark things.  \nThis was the dark of the night, but  \nnot so dark as that, just the dark  \nof when a candle burns down to the last  \ncandle, the empty dark of when a  \ndoor's bolt has just failed and a  \ndog can have the room. It's no more  \nthan that, really. I'm just a tavern  \nkeeper, and I'm not likely to fear  \nthe night or even to be afraid of men,  \nmuch. Not often, though, for  \nthere aren't many men who come to Rook's  \nHold, and I've never had to  \nfight off no dog, the few who have  \ncome for the beer in the past have  \nbeen few enough that I don't remember their names.

    "19": "\nCollegiate aviation schools vary widely in terms of the  programs they offer, how long their programs take to complete, and what students  pay for the programs. It takes between 2 and 4 years to graduate a pilot  degree program in a public collegiate aviation school, while program length at a private for-profit  collegiate aviation school may range from 2 to 6 years. About one- half of pilot students graduate with flight instructor certificates, which can enable  graduates to begin earning flight time required to become a  commercial pilot. The majority of collegiate aviation schools  that offer pilot programs are located at small and medium-sized airports,  some of which are controlled airspace or non-primary airports. Many of the  collegiate aviation schools we identified are public, but some are private nonprofit or private  for-profit, and several provide financial aid to students. Collegiate  aviation schools offer different types of pilot programs, including  four-year programs, and vary in compliance with FAA regulations  in the area of their pilot curriculum. Among 147  U.S. colleges and universities that offered at least one professional  pilot degree program during academic year 2015\u20132016, 92 are FAA-certificated,  and nearly all of these schools have at least one program with a   \ncommercial pilot certificate. The FAA-certificated collegiate aviation  schools we identified offered a pilot program for an unacceptably low percentage of  enrollment compared to the total number of students who could  pursue aviation studies. About 43 percent of the FAA-certificated  collegiate aviation schools offered a program that leads to  failing grades for at least one course requirement, and approximately 75  percent had at least one course for which no graduates met a   \nminimum standard. FAA is responsible for regulating  civilian aviation, which includes pilot training and certification.  Prohibition of improper training practices. In response to our report (GAO-15-314), FAA  will require each FAA-certificated flight school to submit its student records for  inspection by FAA inspectors every year, focused on training records for  pilots pursuing FAA certificates and ratings. In addition, FAA will  review each FAA-certificated school to verify that its certification was  obtained in accordance with FAA regulations and standards. For the  remaining FAA-certificated schools that do not seek certification, FAA  will continue to closely monitor the schools during  a biennial inspection cycle for pilot certificate and  rating certifications of students, and take necessary actions to  ensure that students meet FAA training curriculum requirements.\n\nFlight instructor turnover\u2014the turnover of flight instructors from  collegiate aviation schools\u2014is a key challenge facing collegiate  aviation schools. There is a shortage of experienced flight  instructors that can prevent collegiate aviation schools from training enough  pilots to meet the increasing demand for commercial air travel. In an  effort to reduce some of the challenges associated with instructor turnover and flight instruction that varies from school to  school, the FAA is considering two approaches for  expanding experienced flight instructor availability. First, the FAA  will require certified schools to ensure that all flight instructors\u2014  experienced and newly-certified\u2014who train students to obtain pilot certificates and  ratings meet minimum requirements for certification, including 2  years of flight instructor experience. Second, if FAA  successfully implements a new regulation that will permit flight  instructors who meet minimum certification criteria to train other  pilots to obtain their own flight instructor certificate, fewer recently-certified  flight instructors will leave the profession. However,  there are other possible approaches to addressing flight instructor turnover. We recommend that the FAA  consider revising the regulations to allow certified flight schools to obtain  authorized instructor credentials with higher experience requirements and encourage  collegiate aviation schools to make flight instructor training a more viable career alternative by establishing a national certification and training body of flight instructors, increasing  professionalization efforts for the field, and developing an active, online community.\n\nIn addition, pilot schools must meet FAA regulations and standards with respect to  pilot program curriculum, student records, and school quality and safety.  FAA inspectors will continue to visit these schools each year to ensure that they meet FAA regulatory criteria. Collegiate aviation schools will likely continue to experience some challenges that are unique to their  training environment, such as challenges related to student enrollment, instructors  recruiting, and the cost of administering their programs. However, FAA should consider changes to regulations that would address some of the issues related to these issues. The FAA could also assist schools with infrastructure issues that cannot be readily resolved by  schools, including the acquisition of real estate to store and maintain training  aircraft. FAA should also continue to require schools to publish"
